        - related rules: forming past participles of regular and irregular verbs.

    - Common Confusions

      - been vs. gone

        - explanation: "been" implies a visit or experience that has ended (the person is no longer there), while "gone" suggests the person is still at the location.

          - **Been**: "I've been to Paris." (Visited and returned.)

          - **Gone**: "He has gone to the store." (He is currently at the store.)
