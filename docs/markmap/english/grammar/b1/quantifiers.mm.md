        - usage notes or tips:
          - **Informal Usage**: Primarily used in conversational English and informal writing. Adds a casual tone to the statement.

          - **Synonyms**: Alternatives include "for a long time," "forever," or "since forever," but "for ages" adds a more relaxed and colloquial feel.
          - **Position in Sentence**: Usually placed at the end of a sentence but can also appear in the middle for emphasis.
        - exceptions or challenges:
          - **Formality**: Should be avoided in formal writing or professional contexts where precise time expressions are necessary.
          - **Clarity**: Being non-specific, it may need to be complemented with exact time indicators (e.g., "for three years") if clarity is essential.
          - **Overuse**: Relying too heavily on "for ages" can make the language seem repetitive. Use it judiciously to maintain variety in expression.

          - **Continuous Actions**: Often used with present perfect tenses to indicate actions that started in the past and are still happening.
          - **Synonyms**: Alternatives include "from" a specific time, but "since" specifically connects the start point to the present.
