# Grammar

- B1
  - Present Perfect
    - form
      - affirmative sentences
        - explanation: using have/has + past participle to state that an action has occurred at an unspecified time before now.
        - examples:
          - I have visited Paris.
          - She has finished her homework.
        - usage notes: used when the exact time of the action is not important or not specified.
        - exceptions: some verbs do not commonly use the present perfect, such as stative verbs like "know" or "believe."
        - related rules: formation of past participles.
      - negative sentences
        - explanation: using have/has + not + past participle to indicate that an action has not occurred.
        - examples:
          - They have not seen that movie.
          - He has not started his project.
        - usage notes: contractions are commonly used in spoken English (haven't, hasn't).
        - exceptions: similar to affirmative sentences, some verbs are rarely used in the negative form.
        - related rules: negation in other tenses.
      - question sentences
        - explanation: inverting have/has with the subject to ask if an action has occurred.
        - examples:
          - Have you ever traveled abroad?
          - Has she finished her work?
        - usage notes: often used with question words like "have you ever" or "has she."
        - exceptions: questions typically require an auxiliary verb, so main verbs do not invert.
        - related rules: question formation in other tenses.
    - uses
      - experiences
        - explanation: to talk about life experiences without specifying when they happened.
        - examples:
          - I have tried sushi.
          - She has never ridden a horse.
        - usage notes: often used with "ever" and "never."
        - exceptions: not used for specific past events with a defined time.
        - related rules: using "once," "twice," etc.
      - recent actions
        - explanation: to describe actions that have recently been completed and have relevance to the present.
        - examples:
          - He has just left the office.
          - They have recently moved to a new house.
        - usage notes: often used with adverbs like "just," "recently," and "lately."
        - exceptions: not used for actions that are not connected to the present.
        - related rules: using "just" in other tenses.
      - results in the present
        - explanation: to indicate that a past action has a present consequence or result.
        - examples:
          - She has lost her keys. (She still doesn't have them.)
          - I have broken my phone. (It is still broken.)
        - usage notes: emphasizes the current state resulting from a past action.
        - exceptions: not used when the result is not directly related to the present.
        - related rules: using the present simple to describe current states.
    - time expressions
      - since
        - explanation: used to indicate the starting point of an action that continues to the present.
        - examples:
          - I have lived here since 2010.
          - They have been friends since childhood.
        - usage notes: followed by a specific point in time.

        - related rules: using "yet" in questions and negatives.
      - yet

        - usage notes: commonly used with the present perfect.
        - exceptions: not used in affirmative sentences.
        - related rules: using "already" in affirmative sentences.
    - differences from simple past
      - unspecified time vs. specified time
        - explanation: present perfect does not specify when an action occurred, whereas simple past does.
        - examples:
          - Present Perfect: I have visited London.
          - Simple Past: I visited London last year.
        - usage notes: use present perfect for experiences and simple past for completed actions at a specific time.
        - exceptions: some actions can use both tenses depending on context.
        - related rules: choosing the correct tense based on time references.
      - connection to the present
        - explanation: present perfect emphasizes the relevance of past actions to the present moment.
        - examples:
          - Present Perfect: She has lost her keys. (Still lost now.)
          - Simple Past: She lost her keys yesterday. (Specific past event.)
        - usage notes: use present perfect when the past action affects the present.
        - exceptions: not all past actions with present relevance use present perfect.
        - related rules: using present simple for current states.
    - questions and negatives
      - forming questions
        - explanation: using inversion of have/has and the subject to form questions.
        - examples:
          - Have you seen this movie?
          - Has he finished his work?
        - usage notes: questions often seek confirmation or information about past actions.
        - exceptions: questions with question words may have different structures.
        - related rules: question formation in other tenses.
      - forming negatives
        - explanation: adding "not" after have/has to negate the present perfect.
        - examples:
          - I have not (haven't) visited that place.
          - She has not (hasn't) finished her assignment.
        - usage notes: contractions are common in spoken and informal written English.
        - exceptions: some verbs may have different negation patterns.
        - related rules: negation in other tenses.
    - related structures
      - present perfect continuous
        - explanation: using have/has been + present participle to emphasize the duration or ongoing nature of an action.
        - examples:
          - I have been studying for two hours.
          - They have been working on the project all day.
        - usage notes: used to highlight the continuous aspect of actions that started in the past and continue to the present.
        - exceptions: not used for actions that are completed.
        - related rules: difference between present perfect and present perfect continuous.
      - past participles
        - explanation: the third form of verbs used in the formation of the present perfect.
        - examples:
          - have eaten, has gone, have seen
          - She has written a letter.
        - usage notes: irregular verbs have unique past participle forms.
        - exceptions: regular verbs typically add -ed, but some have irregular forms.
        - related rules: forming past participles of regular and irregular verbs.
