  - Relative Clauses
    - Types of Relative Clauses
      - defining relative clauses
        - explanation: Provide essential information about the noun they modify, without which the sentence would change its meaning.
        - examples:
          - The book that I borrowed was fascinating.
          - She is the teacher who helped me the most.
        - usage notes: Do not use commas to separate defining relative clauses from the rest of the sentence.
        - exceptions: When additional non-essential information is included, it becomes a non-defining relative clause.
        - related rules: non-defining relative clauses, restrictive clauses
      - non-defining relative clauses
        - explanation: Add extra information about a noun, which can be omitted without changing the fundamental meaning of the sentence.
        - examples:
          - My brother, who lives in New York, is visiting us next week.
          - The Eiffel Tower, which is in Paris, attracts millions of tourists each year.
        - usage notes: Use commas to separate non-defining relative clauses from the main clause.
        - exceptions: Non-defining clauses are only used with specific relative pronouns like who, which, whose.
        - related rules: defining relative clauses, appositives
    - Relative Pronouns
      - who
        - explanation: Refers to people and acts as the subject of the relative clause.
        - examples:
          - The artist who painted this masterpiece is famous.
          - She is the friend who always supports me.
        - usage notes: Use "who" when referring to the subject of the clause.
        - exceptions: Do not use "who" for objects or things.
        - related rules: whom, that
      - whom
        - explanation: Refers to people and acts as the object of the relative clause.
        - examples:
          - The person whom you met yesterday is my cousin.
          - She is someone whom I admire greatly.
        - usage notes: "Whom" is more formal and is used when the pronoun is the object in the clause.
        - exceptions: In informal English, "whom" is often replaced with "who."
        - related rules: who, that
      - which
        - explanation: Refers to animals or things and can act as the subject or object of the relative clause.
        - examples:
          - The car which I bought last week is already having issues.
          - She adopted a dog which loves to play fetch.
        - usage notes: Use "which" for non-human subjects.
        - exceptions: Do not use "which" for people.
        - related rules: that
      - that
        - explanation: Can refer to people, animals, or things and can act as the subject or object of the relative clause.
        - examples:
          - The house that Jack built is now for sale.
          - She is the manager that oversees the project.
        - usage notes: "That" is versatile and can be used in both defining and non-defining clauses (though less common in non-defining clauses).
        - exceptions: Do not use "that" in non-defining relative clauses.
        - related rules: who, which
      - whose
        - explanation: Indicates possession and can refer to people, animals, or things.
        - examples:
          - The student whose laptop was stolen reported it to the teacher.

        - usage notes: Use "whose" to show ownership within the relative clause.
        - exceptions: None specific.
        - related rules: which, that
    - Omitting Relative Pronouns
      - explanation: In defining relative clauses, the relative pronoun can be omitted when it acts as the object of the clause.
      - examples:
        - The book I borrowed was fascinating.
        - The person you called is unavailable.
      - usage notes: Omission is only possible when the relative pronoun is the object, not the subject.
      - exceptions: Cannot omit the relative pronoun when it is the subject of the clause.
      - related rules: relative pronouns, defining relative clauses
    - Reduced Relative Clauses
      - explanation: Simplify relative clauses by removing the relative pronoun and using a present or past participle.
      - examples:
        - The man living next door is a doctor. (instead of "The man who is living next door is a doctor.")
        - The cake baked by Sarah was delicious. (instead of "The cake that was baked by Sarah was delicious.")
      - usage notes: Common in formal writing to make sentences more concise.
      - exceptions: Not typically used in spoken English; clarity must be maintained.
      - related rules: relative clauses, sentence reduction
    - Sentence Structure
      - position of relative clauses
        - explanation: Relative clauses usually follow immediately after the noun they modify.
        - examples:
          - The teacher who teaches English is very kind.
          - I visited the museum that opened last year.
        - usage notes: Ensure that the relative clause is placed close to the noun it modifies to avoid confusion.
        - exceptions: Complex sentences may require rephrasing to maintain clarity.
        - related rules: noun phrases, modifier placement
      - punctuation
        - explanation: Use commas to set off non-defining relative clauses; no commas for defining relative clauses.
        - examples:
          - Defining: Students who study hard achieve better results.
          - Non-defining: My friend, who lives abroad, is coming to visit.
        - usage notes: Incorrect punctuation can change the meaning of the sentence.
        - exceptions: Some styles may vary, but standard grammar rules should generally be followed.
        - related rules: defining vs non-defining clauses, comma usage
    - Common Mistakes
      - using non-defining clauses without commas
        - explanation: Omitting commas can make the sentence unclear and change its meaning.
        - examples:
          - Incorrect: My brother who lives in London is visiting.
          - Correct: My brother, who lives in London, is visiting.
        - usage notes: Always use commas for non-defining relative clauses to indicate additional information.
        - exceptions: None specific.
        - related rules: punctuation in relative clauses
      - choosing incorrect relative pronouns
        - explanation: Using "who" for objects or things instead of appropriate pronouns like "which" or "that."
        - examples:
          - Incorrect: The car who I bought is new.
          - Correct: The car that I bought is new.
        - usage notes: Ensure the relative pronoun matches the noun it refers to in terms of person, number, and type.
        - exceptions: "That" can be used for people and things in defining clauses.
        - related rules: relative pronouns usage
      - incorrect omission of relative pronouns

        - examples:
          - Incorrect: The teacher is very kind who helps us.
          - Correct: The teacher who helps us is very kind.
        - usage notes: Only omit relative pronouns when they are objects, not subjects.

          - The city where I was born is beautiful.
          - This is the restaurant where we first met.
        - usage notes: "Where" is specifically used to refer to locations.

          - The person whose phone was stolen reported it.
          - The park where we had a picnic is closed.
        - usage notes: Different relative pronouns serve different functions and refer to different types of nouns.
