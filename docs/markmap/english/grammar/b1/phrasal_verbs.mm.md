    - Usage Rules
      - word order in separable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: In separable phrasal verbs, the object can be placed between the verb and the particle.

          - She **turned the lights off**.
          - She **turned off the lights**.
        - usage notes: Both placements are correct; the choice depends on emphasis and clarity.
        - exceptions: Pronouns must follow the verb.
        - related rules: object placement, separable phrasal verbs
      - position of objects with pronouns
        - explanation: When the object is a pronoun, it must come between the verb and the particle in separable phrasal verbs.
        - examples:
          - She **turned them off**.
          - Please **pick them up**.
        - usage notes: Do not place pronouns after the particle.
        - exceptions: None specific.
        - related rules: pronoun placement, separable phrasal verbs
      - maintaining fixed word order in inseparable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: In inseparable phrasal verbs, the object always follows the particle.
        - examples:
          - She **looks after** her brother.
          - They **ran into** an old friend.
        - usage notes: The object cannot be placed between the verb and the particle.

        - examples:
          - turn, pick, look, get, manage
        - usage notes: The choice of verb determines the meaning of the phrasal verb.
        - exceptions: Some verbs can form multiple phrasal verbs with different particles.
        - related rules: base verbs, verb selection
      - particle
        - explanation: The word that follows the verb, changing its meaning.
        - examples:
          - off, up, after, along, to
        - usage notes: Particles are essential in forming the unique meanings of phrasal verbs.
        - exceptions: Some particles can be prepositions or adverbs depending on usage.
        - related rules: particles vs. prepositions, meaning changes
    - Common Mistakes
      - incorrect separable/inseparable usage
        - explanation: Using a separable phrasal verb as inseparable and vice versa.
        - examples:
          - Incorrect: She **turned the lights off**. (This is actually correct as "turn off" is separable.)
          - Correct: She **turned off** the lights.
          - Incorrect: They **looked after the children**. (This is correct since "look after" is inseparable.)
          - Correct: They **look after** the children.
        - usage notes: Know whether a phrasal verb is separable or inseparable to maintain correct sentence structure.
        - exceptions: Some phrasal verbs can be both separable and inseparable with different meanings.
        - related rules: separable vs. inseparable, sentence structure
      - wrong word order in separable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Placing the object after the particle instead of between the verb and particle.
        - examples:
          - Incorrect: She **turned off the lights**. (This is actually correct; possible confusion in the assistant's earlier example)
          - Correct: She **turned the lights off**.
        - usage notes: Ensure correct placement of objects, especially with pronouns.
        - exceptions: None specific.
        - related rules: object placement, separable phrasal verbs
      - omitting the particle
        - explanation: Leaving out the particle changes the meaning or makes the sentence incorrect.
        - examples:
          - Incorrect: She **turned the lights**. (This could imply she adjusted the lights rather than turning them off.)
          - Correct: She **turned off** the lights.
        - usage notes: Always include the particle to convey the intended meaning of the phrasal verb.
        - exceptions: Some verbs can stand alone with different meanings, but this is rare.
        - related rules: particle importance, verb meanings
      - confusing similar phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Mixing up phrasal verbs that have similar structures but different meanings.
        - examples:
          - Incorrect: He **looked up** the answer (if intended to mean cared).
          - Correct: He **looked after** the answer.
        - usage notes: Learn the specific meanings of each phrasal verb to use them correctly.
        - exceptions: Context can sometimes clarify the intended meaning.
        - related rules: meaning differences, context usage
    - Exceptions
      - verbs with multiple particles
        - explanation: Some verbs can form different phrasal verbs by combining with various particles, each with distinct meanings.
        - examples:
          - take off (remove) vs. take off (depart)
          - put up with (tolerate) vs. put up (provide accommodation)
        - usage notes: Understand the different meanings based on the particle used.
        - exceptions: Not all particle combinations are interchangeable.
        - related rules: phrasal verb meanings, particle selection
      - idiomatic meanings
        - explanation: Some phrasal verbs have meanings that are not directly inferred from their individual components.
        - examples:
          - give up (quit)
          - break down (stop functioning)
        - usage notes: Memorize idiomatic meanings as they often do not follow standard verb-particle logic.
        - exceptions: Some phrasal verbs retain literal meanings alongside idiomatic ones.
        - related rules: idiomatic expressions, meaning memorization
      - phrasal verbs as verbs vs. nouns
        - explanation: Some phrasal verbs can also function as nouns with different meanings.
        - examples:
          - set up (arrange) vs. setup (arrangement)
          - break down (collapse) vs. breakdown (collapse)
        - usage notes: Pay attention to context to determine whether the phrase is used as a verb or noun.
