  - Adjectives

    - definition and usage

      - explanation: Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns, giving more information about a person, place, or thing.
      - examples:
        - The big dog is barking.
        - She has a beautiful dress.
      - usage notes: Adjectives usually come before the noun they describe or after linking verbs like "be."
      - exceptions: Some adjectives (e.g., "afraid," "asleep") are only used after linking verbs.
      - related rules: Order of adjectives, adverbs.

    - position of adjectives

      - explanation: Adjectives can be placed before a noun (attributive) or after a linking verb (predicative).
      - examples:
        - Attributive: The tall man is here.
        - Predicative: The man is tall.
      - usage notes: When describing with a linking verb, the adjective comes after the verb, modifying the subject.
      - exceptions: Some adjectives are rarely used predicatively, such as "utter" (e.g., "utter nonsense").
      - related rules: Linking verbs, noun phrases.

    - order of adjectives

      - explanation: When using multiple adjectives, there is a specific order: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose.
      - examples:
        - She wore a beautiful (opinion), long (size), red (color) dress.
        - They live in an old (age), wooden (material) house.
      - usage notes: Not all adjectives need to be used at once, but when more than one is used, follow this order.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Noun phrases, describing objects.

    - comparative adjectives

      - explanation: Comparative adjectives are used to compare two people or things, often formed by adding '-er' or using 'more.'
      - examples:
        - She is taller than her sister.
        - This book is more interesting than that one.
      - usage notes: For short adjectives (one syllable), add '-er'; for longer adjectives (two syllables or more), use 'more.'
      - exceptions: Irregular comparatives like "good" -> "better," "bad" -> "worse."
      - related rules: Superlative adjectives.

    - superlative adjectives

      - explanation: Superlative adjectives are used to show the highest degree of a quality, usually by adding '-est' or using 'most.'
      - examples:
        - This is the tallest building in the city.
        - She is the most intelligent student in the class.
      - usage notes: Use 'the' before the superlative form. For short adjectives, add '-est'; for longer adjectives, use 'most.'
      - exceptions: Irregular superlatives like "good" -> "best," "bad" -> "worst."
      - related rules: Comparative adjectives, using articles with adjectives.

    - adjectives with linking verbs

      - explanation: Some adjectives are used with linking verbs (like "be," "seem," "look") to describe the subject.
      - examples:
        - She seems happy today.
        - The soup smells delicious.
      - usage notes: Linking verbs connect the subject to an adjective that describes it, not to an action.
      - exceptions: Not all adjectives can be used with linking verbs.
      - related rules: Verb types (linking, action).

    - irregular adjectives
      - explanation: Some adjectives do not follow the regular patterns for comparatives and superlatives.
      - examples:
        - Good -> better -> best.
        - Bad -> worse -> worst.
      - usage notes: Memorize these irregular forms, as they do not follow the usual rules for adjective comparison.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Comparatives, superlatives.
