  - Demonstratives (this, that, these, those)

    - singular demonstratives: this and that

      - explanation: 'This' is used to refer to something close to the speaker, while 'that' is used to refer to something farther away. Both are used with singular nouns.
      - examples:
        - This is my pen. (near)
        - That is your car. (far)
      - usage notes: Use 'this' for objects or people that are near in space or time and 'that' for objects or people farther away.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Demonstratives with singular nouns and demonstrative adjectives.

    - plural demonstratives: these and those

      - explanation: 'These' is used to refer to multiple things close to the speaker, and 'those' is used to refer to multiple things farther away. Both are used with plural nouns.
      - examples:
        - These are my books. (near)
        - Those are her shoes. (far)
      - usage notes: Use 'these' when referring to things nearby and 'those' when referring to things farther away.

      - examples:
        - This car is fast.
        - Those dogs are barking loudly.
      - usage notes: Demonstrative adjectives must always be followed by a noun, and they clarify which noun is being referred to.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Adjectives and determiners.

    - demonstratives in time expressions

      - explanation: Demonstratives can also refer to time, with 'this' referring to something happening now or soon and 'that' referring to something further in the past or future.
      - examples:
        - This weekend, I will visit my parents.
        - That day was unforgettable.
      - usage notes: 'This' is often used for present or near-future events, while 'that' refers to something more distant in time.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Time expressions with demonstratives.

    - distinguishing between demonstratives
      - explanation: Choosing the right demonstrative depends on the context and proximity (physical or temporal) to the speaker.
      - examples:
        - This is my favorite movie. (near, singular)
        - Those are my keys on the table. (far, plural)
      - usage notes: Demonstratives should always agree in number with the noun they describe (singular/plural).
