  - Present Simple

    - affirmative sentences

      - explanation: In the Present Simple tense, affirmative sentences follow the structure: subject + base verb (for I, you, we, they) or subject + verb with 's' or 'es' (for he, she, it).
      - examples:
        - I walk to school every day.
        - She plays tennis on Sundays.
      - usage notes: Add 's' or 'es' to the verb for third-person singular subjects (he, she, it).
      - exceptions: Verbs ending in 'y' preceded by a consonant change to 'ies' in third-person singular (e.g., "study" -> "studies").
      - related rules: Negative and interrogative sentences.

    - negative sentences

      - explanation: For negative sentences in the Present Simple, use the auxiliary 'do not' (don't) or 'does not' (doesn't) + base verb.
      - examples:
        - They do not like coffee.
        - He doesn't go to the gym.
      - usage notes: Use 'doesn't' for third-person singular and 'don't' for all other subjects.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Affirmative and interrogative sentences.

    - interrogative sentences

      - explanation: To form questions in the Present Simple, use 'do' or 'does' + subject + base verb.
      - examples:
        - Do you speak English?
        - Does she work here?
      - usage notes: Use 'does' for third-person singular subjects and 'do' for all other subjects. The main verb stays in its base form.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Yes/no questions and wh-questions.

    - uses of present simple

      - explanation: The Present Simple is used to describe habitual actions, facts, and general truths.

        - The sun rises in the east. (general truth)
        - He drinks coffee every morning. (habitual action)

    - adverbs of frequency with present simple

        - She always goes to bed early.
        - I never eat breakfast.
      - usage notes: Place adverbs of frequency before the main verb but after the verb 'to be'.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Position of adverbs in sentences.

    - spelling changes in third-person singular
      - explanation: Verbs that end in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, or -o add 'es' in the third-person singular form.

        - She watches TV every night.
        - He goes to the office by bus.
      - usage notes: Add 'es' to verbs ending in -s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, or -o in the third-person singular.
