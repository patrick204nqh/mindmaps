  - Nouns

    - singular and plural nouns

      - explanation: Nouns can be singular (one) or plural (more than one). Plurals are usually formed by adding -s or -es to the singular noun.
      - examples:
        - A cat (singular) -> Cats (plural)
        - A box (singular) -> Boxes (plural)
      - usage notes: Use singular nouns when referring to one object, and plural nouns when referring to two or more objects.
      - exceptions: Some nouns have irregular plural forms (e.g., man -> men, child -> children).
      - related rules: Countable and uncountable nouns.

    - countable and uncountable nouns

      - explanation: Countable nouns refer to things that can be counted (e.g., "apple"), while uncountable nouns refer to things that cannot be individually counted (e.g., "water").
      - examples:
        - Countable: I have three apples.
        - Uncountable: I need some water.
      - usage notes: Use 'a' or 'an' with singular countable nouns and quantifiers like 'some' or 'any' with uncountable nouns.
      - exceptions: Some nouns can be both countable and uncountable depending on the context (e.g., "chicken" as food vs. the animal).
      - related rules: Quantifiers (some, any, few, many).

    - proper and common nouns

      - explanation: Proper nouns refer to specific names of people, places, or things and are always capitalized. Common nouns are general names of things.
      - examples:
        - Proper: London is a city.
        - Common: The city is large.
      - usage notes: Always capitalize proper nouns. Common nouns are only capitalized at the beginning of a sentence.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Articles with proper and common nouns.

    - possessive nouns

      - explanation: Possessive nouns show ownership by adding 's to singular nouns or just an apostrophe to plural nouns.
      - examples:
        - This is Sarah's book.
        - The teachers' room is upstairs.
      - usage notes: The position of the apostrophe depends on whether the noun is singular or plural.
      - exceptions: Irregular plural nouns also use 's (e.g., children's toys).
      - related rules: Possessive adjectives (my, your, his, etc.).

    - compound nouns

      - explanation: A compound noun is made up of two or more words that together form a single noun (e.g., toothpaste, mother-in-law).
      - examples:
        - Toothpaste is used for brushing teeth.
        - My mother-in-law is visiting.
      - usage notes: Compound nouns can be written as one word, hyphenated, or as separate words.
      - exceptions: The plural form can change depending on the type of compound noun (e.g., mothers-in-law).
      - related rules: Pluralization of compound nouns.

    - collective nouns
      - explanation: Collective nouns refer to a group of individuals or things as a single entity (e.g., family, team).
      - examples:
        - The team is winning the game.
        - My family is big.
      - usage notes: Collective nouns can take singular or plural verbs depending on whether the group acts as one or as individuals.
      - exceptions: In British English, collective nouns are often used with plural verbs (e.g., "The team are playing well").
      - related rules: Agreement with collective nouns (singular/plural verbs).
