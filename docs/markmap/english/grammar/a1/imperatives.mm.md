        - Please sit down.
      - usage notes: The subject 'you' is implied, so it is not stated. Use the base form of the verb.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative imperatives, polite requests.

      - explanation: To give a command not to do something, use 'do not' (don't) + base verb.
      - examples:
        - Don’t touch that!
