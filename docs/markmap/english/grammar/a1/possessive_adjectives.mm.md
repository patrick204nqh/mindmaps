  - Possessive Adjectives (my, your, his, her)

    - definition and usage

      - explanation: Possessive adjectives show ownership or relationship and are used before nouns to describe who something belongs to.
      - examples:
        - This is my book.
        - He is her brother.
      - usage notes: Possessive adjectives must always be followed by a noun and change based on the owner, not the object.
      - exceptions: Possessive adjectives do not take an apostrophe ('), unlike possessive nouns (e.g., John's).
      - related rules: Possessive pronouns (mine, yours, his, hers, etc.).

    - list of possessive adjectives

      - explanation: Common possessive adjectives include my, your, his, her, its, our, and their. These words replace the noun's possessor.
      - examples:
        - My car is blue.
        - Their house is big.
      - usage notes: Use 'my' for the speaker, 'your' for the listener, 'his/her/its' for singular third person, and 'our/their' for plural.
      - exceptions: 'Its' is possessive but does not have an apostrophe (e.g., not "it's").
      - related rules: Third-person singular and plural distinctions.

    - possessive adjectives vs. possessive pronouns

      - explanation: Possessive adjectives are used before nouns (my book), while possessive pronouns stand alone (the book is mine).
      - examples:
        - This is my pen. The pen is mine.
        - Their car is red. The red car is theirs.
      - usage notes: Possessive adjectives modify a noun, while possessive pronouns replace the noun entirely.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Subject and object pronouns.

    - agreement with nouns

      - explanation: Possessive adjectives must agree with the owner, not the object. The noun following the adjective can be singular or plural.
      - examples:
        - This is my dog. (singular)
        - These are their books. (plural)
      - usage notes: The form of the possessive adjective does not change whether the noun is singular or plural.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Agreement between subject pronouns and verbs.

    - possessive adjectives with family members
      - explanation: Possessive adjectives are commonly used with family member nouns (e.g., my father, her sister).
      - examples:
        - My mother is a doctor.
        - His brother lives in New York.
      - usage notes: When talking about family, it's typical to use possessive adjectives rather than possessive pronouns.
      - exceptions: In some languages, possessive adjectives may not be used in the same way with family members, but they are required in English.
      - related rules: Nouns and articles with family members.
