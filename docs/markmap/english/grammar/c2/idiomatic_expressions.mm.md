    - Types of Idiomatic Expressions
      - fixed idioms
        - explanation: Idiomatic expressions that have a fixed structure and cannot be altered without changing their meaning.
        - examples:
          - "Break the ice"
          - "Spill the beans"
        - usage notes: Use fixed idioms as complete units to convey specific meanings.
        - exceptions: Attempting to modify fixed idioms can lead to confusion or loss of meaning.
        - related rules: idiom integrity, fixed expressions
      - variable idioms
        - explanation: Idiomatic expressions that allow some flexibility in their components while retaining their overall meaning.
        - examples:
          - "Kick the bucket" vs. "Kick the habit"
          - "Hit the books" vs. "Hit the road"
        - usage notes: Understand the core components that must remain unchanged to preserve the idiom’s meaning.
        - exceptions: Not all parts of the idiom can be altered; some variations may change the meaning entirely.
        - related rules: idiom flexibility, semantic consistency
      - phrasal idioms
