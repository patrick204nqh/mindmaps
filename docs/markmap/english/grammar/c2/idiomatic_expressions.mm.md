        - examples:
          - "Break the ice"
          - "Spill the beans"
        - usage notes: Use fixed idioms as complete units to convey specific meanings.
        - exceptions: Attempting to modify fixed idioms can lead to confusion or loss of meaning.
        - related rules: idiom integrity, fixed expressions
      - variable idioms
        - explanation: Idiomatic expressions that allow some flexibility in their components while retaining their overall meaning.
        - examples:
