  - Complex Clause Structures
    - relative clauses
      - defining relative clauses
        - explanation: provide essential information about the noun they modify without commas.
        - examples:
          - The book that you gave me was fascinating.
          - Students who study regularly perform better.
        - usage notes: Use "that" or "who" for defining clauses; omit "that" in some cases.
        - exceptions: Non-defining relative clauses require commas and use "which" or "who."
        - related rules: non-defining relative clauses, relative pronouns.
      - non-defining relative clauses
        - explanation: add extra, non-essential information about a noun, separated by commas.
        - examples:
          - My brother, who lives in New York, is visiting us.
          - The car, which was newly purchased, broke down.
        - usage notes: Use "which" for things and "who" for people; always include commas.
        - exceptions: Do not use non-defining clauses for essential information.
        - related rules: defining relative clauses, relative pronouns.
      - relative pronouns
        - explanation: words that introduce relative clauses, linking them to the main clause.
        - examples:
          - who, whom, whose, which, that
          - The artist whose work you admire is famous.
        - usage notes: Choose the appropriate relative pronoun based on the noun being modified and its role in the relative clause.

        - related rules: relative clauses, pronoun case.
    - adverbial clauses
      - time clauses
        - explanation: specify when something happens, introduced by subordinating conjunctions.

          - Although he was tired, he continued working.
          - Even though it was expensive, they bought the car.
