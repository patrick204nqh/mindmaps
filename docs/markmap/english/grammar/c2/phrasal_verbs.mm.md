  - Phrasal Verbs (Expert Level)
    - Types of Phrasal Verbs
      - Separable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs where the verb and particle can be separated by the object.
        - examples:
          - "She **turned** the offer **down**."
          - "They **set** the meeting **up**."
        - usage notes: Commonly used with pronouns and noun objects, allowing flexibility in sentence structure.
        - exceptions: In questions and negative sentences, the particle remains after the verb.
        - related rules: object placement, sentence structure
      - Inseparable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs where the verb and particle cannot be separated by the object.
        - examples:
          - "She **looked after** the children."
          - "They **ran into** some old friends."
        - usage notes: The verb and particle must stay together, regardless of the object.
        - exceptions: None; separation is not allowed.
        - related rules: phrasal verb integrity, verb-particle pairing
      - Three-part phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that consist of a verb followed by two particles, often altering the meaning significantly.
        - examples:
          - "She **ran** the project **off**."
          - "They **put** the plan **forward**."
        - usage notes: Requires careful attention to both particles, as the meaning can change drastically with different particles.
        - exceptions: Less common and typically more formal or idiomatic.
        - related rules: complex phrasal verbs, idiomatic expressions
      - Fixed phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that do not allow for separation or alteration, often idiomatic in nature.
        - examples:
          - "He **came across** an old friend."
          - "They **looked forward to** the event."
        - usage notes: Must be learned as fixed expressions due to their idiomatic meanings.
        - exceptions: Cannot be modified or separated by objects.
        - related rules: idiomatic phrasal verbs, fixed expressions
    - Phrasal Verbs with Multiple Meanings
      - literal vs. idiomatic meanings
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that have both a direct, literal meaning and an idiomatic meaning that differs significantly.
        - examples:
          - "Look up"
            - "I need to **look up** the address." (literal)

        - usage notes: Context is crucial to determine the intended meaning of phrasal verbs with multiple definitions.
        - exceptions: Some phrasal verbs have meanings that are always idiomatic or always literal.
        - related rules: context clues, semantic flexibility
      - phrasal verbs with similar forms but different meanings
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that share the same verb and particle but differ in meaning based on usage.
        - examples:
          - "Get over"
            - "He has finally **gotten over** his illness." (recover)

        - related rules: polysemy, contextual interpretation
    - Advanced Structures
      - phrasal verbs with modal verbs
        - explanation: Combining modal verbs with phrasal verbs to express ability, possibility, necessity, or permission.
        - examples:
          - "You **must look after** your responsibilities."
          - "She **can turn down** the offer if she wants."

        - related rules: register in language, formality levels
      - choosing between phrasal verbs and single verbs
        - explanation: Deciding whether to use a phrasal verb or a more formal single verb based on the context and desired tone.
        - examples:

        - related rules: phrasal verb types, particle placement
      - confusing phrasal verbs with similar meanings
        - explanation: Mixing up phrasal verbs that have similar but distinct meanings, causing confusion.
        - examples:

        - exceptions: Some phrasal verbs are acceptable in both formal and informal contexts.
        - related rules: register in language, formality levels
      - using phrasal verbs incorrectly in different tenses
        - explanation: Applying incorrect tense forms to phrasal verbs, resulting in grammatical errors.
        - examples:

        - related rules: verb conjugation, tense consistency
      - splitting inseparable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Attempting to separate the verb and particle in inseparable phrasal verbs, leading to ungrammatical sentences.

      - categorizing by type or meaning
        - explanation: Organizing phrasal verbs into categories based on their types (separable, inseparable) or meanings to facilitate learning.
        - examples:
          - Grouping separable phrasal verbs together for focused practice.
          - Categorizing phrasal verbs that mean "to cancel" (e.g., cancel, call off, give up).
        - usage notes: Helps in recognizing patterns and relationships between similar phrasal verbs.
        - exceptions: Some phrasal verbs may fit into multiple categories, requiring flexible categorization.
        - related rules: taxonomy in language, pattern recognition

        - examples:
          - "I need to **figure out** the solution by tomorrow."
          - "They decided to **put off** the meeting until next week."
        - usage notes: Reinforces understanding by actively applying phrasal verbs in various contexts.
        - exceptions: Ensure that example sentences accurately reflect the intended meaning of the phrasal verb.
        - related rules: sentence construction, active learning
    - Related Rules
      - modal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs often interact with modal verbs to express necessity, possibility, permission, or ability.
        - examples:

        - related rules: modal verb functions, modal verb structures
      - conditional sentences
        - explanation: Conditional sentences express "if-then" scenarios and often work in tandem with modal verbs to indicate possibilities or hypothetical situations.
        - examples:
          - "If it **rains**, we **will** cancel the trip."
          - "If I **had** more time, I **would** travel."

        - exceptions: Ensure consistency in tense and modal usage within the conditional structure.
        - related rules: conditional types, modal verbs
      - imperative mood
        - explanation: The imperative mood issues commands or requests, sometimes overlapping with phrasal verbs for softer or more direct commands.
        - examples:
          - "Please **look after** the kids."
          - "Don't **put up with** the noise."
        - usage notes: Phrasal verbs can make commands sound more natural and less direct.
