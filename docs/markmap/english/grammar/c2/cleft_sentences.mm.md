  - Cleft Sentences (Advanced)
    - Types of Cleft Sentences
      - it-cleft
        - explanation: A construction that splits a single clause into two clauses to emphasize a particular part of the sentence.
        - examples:
          - "It was **John** who completed the project on time."
          - "It is **under these circumstances** that we must proceed."
        - usage notes: Commonly used to highlight the subject or another element by rephrasing the sentence.
        - exceptions: Overusing it-clefts can make writing sound repetitive or cumbersome.
        - related rules: emphasis techniques, sentence restructuring
      - what-cleft
        - explanation: Uses "what" to create a cleft sentence, emphasizing the thing or action rather than a specific subject.
        - examples:
          - "What **she did** was impressive."
          - "What we need is more time."

        - related rules: pseudo-clefts, emphasis on actions or objects
      - which-cleft
        - explanation: Combines "which" with a noun phrase to emphasize a particular choice or option within a set.
        - examples:
          - "Which **option we choose** will determine our success."
          - "Which **strategy to implement** is still under discussion."
