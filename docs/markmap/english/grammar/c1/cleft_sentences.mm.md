  - Cleft Sentences
    - Types of Cleft Sentences
      - it-cleft
        - explanation: A structure that splits a single clause into two parts to emphasize a particular element, typically using "it" as the subject.
        - examples:
          - It was **John** who **solved** the problem.
          - It is **the environment** that **affects** our health.
        - usage notes: Use it-clefts to highlight specific information and add variety to sentence structures.
        - exceptions: Can make sentences longer and more complex; use sparingly to maintain clarity.
        - related rules: sentence restructuring, emphasis techniques
      - wh-cleft
        - explanation: Also known as pseudo-cleft, this structure uses "what," "who," "where," etc., to emphasize a particular part of the sentence.
        - examples:
          - What I need **is** a good night's sleep.
          - Who she invited **is** still unknown.
        - usage notes: Use wh-clefts to focus on specific information and make sentences more impactful.
        - exceptions: Not suitable for all types of sentences; ensure the emphasized part is clear.
        - related rules: it-cleft, sentence emphasis
      - alternative cleft
        - explanation: Combines elements of both it-cleft and wh-cleft to emphasize different parts of a sentence.
        - examples:
          - It was **because of the rain** that the event **was canceled**.
          - What she wants **is** a new opportunity.
        - usage notes: Use alternative clefts to emphasize reasons or specific desires within a sentence.
        - exceptions: Can lead to overly complex sentences if overused.
        - related rules: it-cleft, wh-cleft, sentence variety
    - Uses of Cleft Sentences
      - emphasis
        - explanation: Cleft sentences are primarily used to place emphasis on a particular part of a sentence.
        - examples:
          - It was **her dedication** that **led to the success**.
          - What you **need** is a reliable source.
        - usage notes: Use cleft sentences to draw the reader's or listener's attention to important information.
        - exceptions: Overusing emphasis can make writing seem forced or unnatural.
        - related rules: emphatic structures, sentence focus
      - clarification
        - explanation: Cleft sentences help clarify which part of the sentence is most important or needs highlighting.
        - examples:
          - It is **the speed** that **makes this car special**.
          - What he **really wants** is a chance to prove himself.
        - usage notes: Use for clearer communication, especially when distinguishing between multiple elements.
        - exceptions: May introduce redundancy if the context is already clear.
        - related rules: sentence restructuring, clarity techniques
      - contrast
        - explanation: Cleft sentences can be used to contrast different ideas or elements within a sentence.
        - examples:
          - It was **not the price** but **the quality** that **won** the customers.
          - What I like **about** this book **is** its intricate plot.
        - usage notes: Employ cleft sentences to highlight differences or opposing elements effectively.
        - exceptions: Ensure that the contrast is logical and enhances understanding.
        - related rules: contrastive structures, adversative linking words
    - Structure
      - it-cleft structure
        - explanation: Consists of "It + be + emphasized element + who/that + clause."
        - examples:
          - It is **she** who **called** earlier.
          - It was **the manager** that **approved** the budget.
        - usage notes: Follow the standard structure to maintain grammatical correctness and emphasis.
        - exceptions: Ensure subject-verb agreement and proper placement of the emphasized element.
        - related rules: subject-verb agreement, clause structure
      - wh-cleft structure
        - explanation: Begins with a wh-word (what, who, where, etc.) followed by a clause that completes the sentence.
        - examples:
          - What **I want** **is** a vacation.
          - Where **they met** **is** still a mystery.
        - usage notes: Use the appropriate wh-word based on what you wish to emphasize.
        - exceptions: Not all sentences can be effectively transformed into wh-clefts.
        - related rules: wh-questions, sentence emphasis
      - alternative cleft structure
        - explanation: Combines elements of it-cleft and wh-cleft to emphasize different parts of a sentence.
        - examples:
          - It was **because of the delay** that **they missed** the train.
          - What **he needs** **is** more time to complete the project.
        - usage notes: Use alternative clefts to emphasize reasons or specific desires within a sentence.
        - exceptions: Can lead to overly complex sentences if overused.
        - related rules: it-cleft, wh-cleft, sentence variety
    - Advanced Features
      - combining cleft sentences with other structures
        - explanation: Integrating cleft sentences with other grammatical structures like conditionals or relative clauses to add complexity and emphasis.
        - examples:
          - It was **only after the meeting** that **we realized** the importance.
          - What **she suggested** **was that we should delay** the project.
        - usage notes: Enhances the depth and sophistication of sentences, suitable for advanced writing.

        - related rules: compound sentences, sentence variety
      - cleft sentences in reported speech
        - explanation: Using cleft sentences within reported speech to emphasize specific information from the original statement.
        - examples:
          - He said that **it was the weather** that **had caused** the delay.
          - She mentioned that **what she needed** **was** more support.

        - examples:
          - Simple statements where emphasis is not needed: "She solved the problem."
          - Overly formal contexts where simpler structures are preferred.
        - usage notes: Reserve cleft sentences for when emphasis or clarification is necessary; otherwise, use simpler sentence structures.
        - exceptions: In creative writing, clefts can be used stylistically even when not strictly necessary.
        - related rules: sentence variety, register in language
      - ambiguous emphasis
        - explanation: When the intended emphasis is unclear, leading to ambiguity in the sentence's meaning.

        - exceptions: Overusing emphatic structures can make writing seem forced or unnatural.
        - related rules: sentence restructuring, emphasis techniques
      - inversion
        - explanation: Changing the normal word order of a sentence, often for emphasis or in specific grammatical contexts.
        - examples:
          - "Never have I **seen** such beauty."
          - "Rarely does she **make** mistakes."
