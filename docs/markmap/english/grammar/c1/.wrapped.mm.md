          - Legal documents where every element must be explicitly stated.
        - usage notes: Use ellipsis and substitution only when the omitted information is clear and does not compromise meaning.
        - exceptions: Highly formal or technical contexts may require full sentence structures.
        - related rules: context-appropriate language, clarity in communication
      - ambiguous omissions
        - explanation: Omitting elements in a way that makes it unclear what is being referred to or replaced.

        - exceptions: None; inversion must follow grammatical rules.
        - related rules: subject-auxiliary inversion, grammatical correctness
      - misplacing adverbs
        - explanation: Placing adverbs in positions that do not trigger or support inversion, resulting in unclear emphasis.
        - examples:
          - Incorrect: "I have never seen such chaos."(While grammatically correct, it lacks the inversion emphasis)
          - Correct: "Never have I seen such chaos."
        - usage notes: Position adverbs at the beginning of the sentence to activate inversion for emphasis.
        - exceptions: Some adverbs may not be suitable for inversion and require alternative structures.
        - related rules: adverb placement, sentence emphasis
      - overusing emphatic inversion
        - explanation: Applying emphatic inversion excessively, making writing or speech seem unnatural or overly dramatic.

          - "Never have I been so surprised, never has anything like this happened before."
        - usage notes: Use inversion sparingly to maintain its impact and avoid redundancy.
        - exceptions: In highly dramatic or stylistic contexts, multiple inversions may be appropriate.
        - related rules: sentence variety, stylistic balance
      - forgetting auxiliary verbs
        - explanation: Omitting necessary auxiliary verbs when performing inversion, resulting in incomplete sentences.
        - examples:

        - related rules: verb forms, auxiliary usage
    - Exceptions
      - not applicable to all sentence types
        - explanation: Emphatic inversion cannot be applied to every sentence; it is limited to specific structures that support emphasis.
        - examples:
          - "Never have I seen such chaos." (Applicable)
          - "I saw him yesterday." (Inversion not applicable)
        - usage notes: Use inversion only when the sentence structure allows for it and when emphasis is needed.
        - exceptions: Simple declarative sentences without supporting adverbs or expressions cannot use inversion.
        - related rules: sentence structure, emphasis techniques
      - limited to certain adverbs and expressions
        - explanation: Only specific adverbs and expressions can trigger emphatic inversion, such as never, rarely, seldom, barely, hardly, and so.

          - Applicable: "Seldom does she smile."
          - Not applicable: "Quickly runs he." (Incorrect)
        - usage notes: Familiarize with the adverbs and expressions that are compatible with inversion.
        - exceptions: Some adverbs may require restructuring rather than inversion.
        - related rules: adverb selection, sentence emphasis
      - cannot be used with all verb forms
        - explanation: Emphatic inversion typically requires auxiliary verbs and cannot be used with all verb forms, especially stative verbs without auxiliaries.
        - examples:
          - Applicable: "Never have I heard such a story."
          - Not applicable: "Never know I what to say." (Incorrect)
