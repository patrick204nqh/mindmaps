        - related rules: sentence variety, coherence
      - inappropriate marker choice
        - explanation: Selecting discourse markers that do not fit the context or intended meaning.
        - examples:
          - Using "however" where "therefore" is needed.
          - Using "in addition" to express contrast.

        - related rules: punctuation, sentence structure
      - using informal markers in formal writing
        - explanation: Employing casual discourse markers in contexts that require formal language.
        - examples:
          - Using "so" instead of "therefore."

        - related rules: register in language, formality levels
      - mismatching markers and sentence structures
        - explanation: Using discourse markers that disrupt the grammatical structure or flow of a sentence.
