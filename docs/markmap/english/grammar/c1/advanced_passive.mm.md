      - present simple passive
        - explanation: The present simple passive is used to describe general truths, habits, or universal facts where the focus is on the action rather than the doer.

      - past simple passive
        - explanation: The past simple passive describes actions that were completed in the past, focusing on the action itself rather than the performer.

      - present perfect passive
        - explanation: The present perfect passive indicates that an action has been completed at an unspecified time before now, with relevance to the present.
        - examples:
