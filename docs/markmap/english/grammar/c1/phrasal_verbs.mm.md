  - Phrasal Verbs (Proficiency)
    - Types of Phrasal Verbs
      - transitive phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that require a direct object to complete their meaning.
        - examples:
          - She **turned down** the invitation.
          - They **set up** a new company.
        - usage notes: Ensure that the direct object is present when using transitive phrasal verbs.
        - exceptions: Some transitive phrasal verbs can also be used intransitively with a change in meaning.
        - related rules: transitive verbs, direct objects
      - intransitive phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that do not require a direct object and can stand alone.
        - examples:
          - The plane **took off** on time.
          - They **broke up** last year.
        - usage notes: Use intransitive phrasal verbs without adding an object.
        - exceptions: Some intransitive phrasal verbs can take optional modifiers or adverbs.
        - related rules: intransitive verbs, sentence completeness
      - separable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs where the verb and particle can be separated by the direct object.
        - examples:
          - She **turned** the invitation **down**.
          - They **set** the company **up**.
        - usage notes: Commonly used with pronouns or noun objects, allowing flexibility in sentence structure.
        - exceptions: In questions and negative sentences, the particle remains after the verb.
        - related rules: object placement, sentence structure
      - inseparable phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs where the verb and particle must stay together and cannot be separated by the object.
        - examples:
          - She **looked after** the children.
          - They **ran into** some old friends.
        - usage notes: Maintain the integrity of the phrasal verb by keeping the verb and particle together.
        - exceptions: None; separation is not allowed.
        - related rules: phrasal verb integrity, verb-particle pairing
    - Phrasal Verbs with Multiple Meanings
      - literal vs. idiomatic meanings
        - explanation: Some phrasal verbs can have both a literal meaning and an idiomatic meaning that differs significantly.
        - examples:
          - "Look up" can mean to search for information or to improve:
            - I need to **look up** the address.
            - Things are starting to **look up**.
          - "Break down" can mean to stop functioning or to become very emotional:
            - The car **broke down** on the highway.
            - She **broke down** in tears.
        - usage notes: Context is crucial to determine the intended meaning of phrasal verbs with multiple definitions.
        - exceptions: Some phrasal verbs have meanings that are always idiomatic or always literal.
        - related rules: context clues, semantic flexibility
      - phrasal verbs with similar forms but different meanings
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that share the same verb and particle but differ in meaning based on usage.
        - examples:
          - "Get over" can mean to recover from something or to remove something:
            - He has finally **gotten over** his illness.
            - **Get over** the fence.
          - "Turn up" can mean to appear unexpectedly or to increase volume:
            - She **turned up** at the party uninvited.
            - Please **turn up** the music.
        - usage notes: Pay attention to the surrounding words and context to understand the specific meaning.

        - related rules: polysemy, contextual interpretation
    - Advanced Structures
      - phrasal verbs with modal verbs
        - explanation: Combining modal verbs with phrasal verbs to express ability, possibility, necessity, or permission.
        - examples:
          - You **must look after** your responsibilities.
          - She **can turn down** the offer if she wants.

        - related rules: modal verb usage, sentence structure
      - phrasal verbs in different tenses
        - explanation: Applying various tenses to phrasal verbs to indicate the time of action.

        - related rules: tense consistency, verb conjugation
      - phrasal verbs in passive voice

        - related rules: register in language, formality levels
      - choosing between phrasal verbs and single verbs
        - explanation: Deciding whether to use a phrasal verb or a more formal single verb based on the context and desired tone.
