# Tenses

## Present Simple

### Structure

- Affirmative: Subject + Verb (s/es)
  - **I/You/We/They**: Use base form of the verb
    - Example: I walk to work.
  - **He/She/It**: Add **s** or **es** to the verb
    - Example: He walks to school.
  - Verbs ending in **-ch, -sh, -ss, -x, -o** get **es**
    - Example: He watches TV.
  - For verbs ending in a consonant + **y**, change the **y** to **ies**
    - Example: She studies English.
- Negative: Subject + do/does not + Verb (base form)
  - **I/You/We/They**: Use **do not** (or **don’t**)
    - Example: I don’t like coffee.
  - **He/She/It**: Use **does not** (or **doesn’t**)
    - Example: She doesn’t drink tea.
- Interrogative: Do/Does + Subject + Verb (base form)
  - Example: Do they play soccer? / Does she play tennis?

### Uses

- **Habitual Actions**
  - Use to talk about repeated actions or routines
  - Example: She walks to school every day.
  - Time expressions: **always**, **often**, **sometimes**, **never**
- **General Truths**
  - Use to express facts or things that are always true
  - Example: The sun rises in the east.
- **Permanent Situations**
  - Use for actions or states that are permanent or generally true
  - Example: He lives in New York.
- **Scheduled Events (Timetables)**
  - Use to refer to future events based on schedules (especially with transportation, events, etc.)
  - Example: The train leaves at 8 PM tonight.
- **State Verbs**
  - Certain verbs are not used in continuous forms and refer to states rather than actions
  - Examples: **know**, **believe**, **understand**, **own**, **seem**
  - Example: She knows the answer. (NOT: She is knowing the answer.)

### Time Expressions

- Use time expressions to clarify repeated actions:
  - **Always**, **usually**, **sometimes**, **often**, **never**
  - **Every day**, **every week**, **every month**
  - **On Mondays**, **in the morning**, **at night**
  - Example: They play football **every weekend**.

### Third-Person Singular Rule

- For **he/she/it** add **s** or **es** to the verb:
  - **Verbs ending in -ch, -sh, -ss, -x, -o** add **es**
    - Example: He watches TV.
  - **Consonant + y**: change **y** to **ies**
    - Example: She studies English.
  - **Irregular verbs** (few examples):
    - **Have** → has
    - **Go** → goes
    - **Do** → does

### Common Mistakes

- **Forgetting the ‘s’ in the third person singular**:
  - **Incorrect**: She walk to school.
  - **Correct**: She **walks** to school.
- **Using Present Continuous for habitual actions**:
  - **Incorrect**: I am going to work every day.
  - **Correct**: I **go** to work every day.
- **Using the wrong auxiliary verb** in questions/negatives:
  - **Incorrect**: She don’t like pizza.
  - **Correct**: She **doesn’t** like pizza.

### Advanced Notes

- **In formal writing**, the Present Simple is often used to describe general truths or facts.
  - Example: "Water boils at 100°C."
- **In headlines or commentary**, the Present Simple may replace the future tense for immediacy:
  - Example: "The President meets with world leaders tomorrow."
- **For storytelling**, the Present Simple is sometimes used to narrate events to create a sense of immediacy:
  - Example: "So, I walk into the room and everyone stares at me."

### Examples in Context

- **Affirmative**:
  - He **works** as a software engineer.
  - They **play** football on weekends.
- **Negative**:
  - She **doesn’t** like broccoli.
  - I **don’t** visit my grandparents very often.
- **Question**:
  - **Do** you know the answer?
  - **Does** he play the piano?

### Differences from Present Continuous

- Present Simple:
  - Use for regular, habitual actions.
  - Example: I work every day.
- Present Continuous:
  - Use for actions happening right now or temporary situations.
  - Example: I am working right now.

### Passive Voice in Present Simple

- The Present Simple can be used in the passive voice to emphasize the action over the subject:
  - Structure: **Object + is/are + past participle**

### Irregular Verbs

    - **Go** → goes
    - **Do** → does
