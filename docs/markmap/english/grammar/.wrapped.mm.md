# Grammar

- A1
  - Adjectives
    - definition and usage
      - explanation: Adjectives are words that describe or modify nouns, giving more information about a person, place, or thing.
      - examples:
        - The big dog is barking.
        - She has a beautiful dress.
      - usage notes: Adjectives usually come before the noun they describe or after linking verbs like "be."
      - exceptions: Some adjectives (e.g., "afraid," "asleep") are only used after linking verbs.
      - related rules: Order of adjectives, adverbs.
    - position of adjectives
      - explanation: Adjectives can be placed before a noun (attributive) or after a linking verb (predicative).
      - examples:
        - Attributive: The tall man is here.
        - Predicative: The man is tall.
      - usage notes: When describing with a linking verb, the adjective comes after the verb, modifying the subject.
      - exceptions: Some adjectives are rarely used predicatively, such as "utter" (e.g., "utter nonsense").
      - related rules: Linking verbs, noun phrases.
    - order of adjectives
      - explanation: When using multiple adjectives, there is a specific order: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose.
      - examples:
        - She wore a beautiful (opinion), long (size), red (color) dress.
        - They live in an old (age), wooden (material) house.
      - usage notes: Not all adjectives need to be used at once, but when more than one is used, follow this order.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Noun phrases, describing objects.
    - comparative adjectives
      - explanation: Comparative adjectives are used to compare two people or things, often formed by adding '-er' or using 'more.'
      - examples:
        - She is taller than her sister.
        - This book is more interesting than that one.
      - usage notes: For short adjectives (one syllable), add '-er'; for longer adjectives (two syllables or more), use 'more.'
      - exceptions: Irregular comparatives like "good" -> "better," "bad" -> "worse."
      - related rules: Superlative adjectives.
    - superlative adjectives
      - explanation: Superlative adjectives are used to show the highest degree of a quality, usually by adding '-est' or using 'most.'
      - examples:
        - This is the tallest building in the city.
        - She is the most intelligent student in the class.
      - usage notes: Use 'the' before the superlative form. For short adjectives, add '-est'; for longer adjectives, use 'most.'
      - exceptions: Irregular superlatives like "good" -> "best," "bad" -> "worst."
      - related rules: Comparative adjectives, using articles with adjectives.
    - adjectives with linking verbs
      - explanation: Some adjectives are used with linking verbs (like "be," "seem," "look") to describe the subject.
      - examples:
        - She seems happy today.
        - The soup smells delicious.
      - usage notes: Linking verbs connect the subject to an adjective that describes it, not to an action.
      - exceptions: Not all adjectives can be used with linking verbs.
      - related rules: Verb types (linking, action).
    - irregular adjectives
      - explanation: Some adjectives do not follow the regular patterns for comparatives and superlatives.
      - examples:
        - Good -> better -> best.
        - Bad -> worse -> worst.
      - usage notes: Memorize these irregular forms, as they do not follow the usual rules for adjective comparison.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Comparatives, superlatives.
  - Adverbs of Frequency (always, never)
    - definition and usage
      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency are words that describe how often something happens. Common adverbs include "always," "usually," "sometimes," "never."
      - examples:
        - She always wakes up early.
        - I never eat fast food.
      - usage notes: These adverbs are typically placed before the main verb but after the verb "to be."
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Present simple tense, word order.
    - placement in sentences
      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency are generally placed before the main verb, but with the verb "to be," they are placed after the verb.
      - examples:
        - He always drinks coffee in the morning.
        - They are never late to class.
      - usage notes: With auxiliary verbs (e.g., "have," "will"), the adverb goes between the auxiliary and the main verb (e.g., "She has always been kind").
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Word order with adverbs.
    - using "always"
      - explanation: "Always" means that something happens every time, without exception.
      - examples:
        - She always studies before a test.
        - We always go to the beach in summer.
      - usage notes: Use "always" to talk about habitual or repeated actions.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Other adverbs of frequency.
    - using "never"
      - explanation: "Never" means that something does not happen at any time.
      - examples:
        - He never eats vegetables.
        - I never forget my keys.
      - usage notes: "Never" is already negative, so it is not used with other negative words like "not" or "don't."
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative adverbs, double negatives.
    - other common adverbs of frequency
      - explanation: Other adverbs of frequency include "usually," "often," "sometimes," and "rarely," which describe how often something happens in varying degrees.
      - examples:
        - She usually walks to school.
        - They sometimes play tennis on weekends.
      - usage notes: These adverbs express frequency from high to low (e.g., "always" for 100%, "rarely" for very low frequency).
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Present simple tense for habitual actions.
    - frequency adverbs and present simple
      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency are commonly used with the present simple tense to describe regular or repeated actions.
      - examples:
        - I always brush my teeth in the morning.
        - They never miss a meeting.
      - usage notes: Adverbs of frequency emphasize how often the action described by the verb occurs.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Present simple tense, habits.
  - Articles (a, an, the)
    - indefinite articles (a, an)
      - explanation: 'A' and 'an' are used with singular, countable nouns to refer to something not specific.
      - examples:
        - She wants to buy a book.
        - I saw an elephant at the zoo.
      - usage notes: Use 'a' before words that start with a consonant sound and 'an' before words that start with a vowel sound.
      - exceptions: The choice of 'a' or 'an' depends on the sound, not the actual letter (e.g., 'a university' because 'university' starts with a consonant sound).
      - related rules: Use of articles with singular and plural nouns.
    - definite article (the)
      - explanation: 'The' is used with both singular and plural nouns when referring to something specific or already known to the speaker and listener.
      - examples:
        - The book on the table is mine.
        - The children are playing outside.
      - usage notes: Use 'the' when both the speaker and listener know which specific person or thing is being referred to.
      - exceptions: No article is used with general categories or plural nouns when speaking generally (e.g., "Books are fun" vs. "The books on the shelf are mine").
      - related rules: No article with general nouns.
    - zero article (no article)
      - explanation: Some nouns, especially proper nouns and uncountable nouns, do not require an article.
      - examples:
        - She lives in London.
        - I like music.
      - usage notes: Do not use articles with proper nouns (names of people, cities, countries, etc.) and most uncountable nouns unless they are specific.
      - exceptions: Use 'the' with proper nouns when referring to something specific (e.g., "the United States," "the Eiffel Tower").
      - related rules: Article use with uncountable nouns.
    - articles with countable and uncountable nouns
      - explanation: Use 'a' or 'an' with singular countable nouns. Uncountable nouns do not use 'a' or 'an' but may use 'the' if specific.
      - examples:
        - I need a pen.
        - The water is cold.
      - usage notes: Countable nouns require an article in singular form, while uncountable nouns generally do not unless they are specific (e.g., "the water").
      - exceptions: Some nouns can be both countable and uncountable depending on context (e.g., "a cake" vs. "some cake").
      - related rules: Quantifiers with uncountable nouns.
    - articles with superlatives and unique nouns
      - explanation: 'The' is always used with superlative adjectives and when referring to something unique.
      - examples:
        - This is the best day of my life.
        - The sun rises in the east.
      - usage notes: Use 'the' before superlatives (best, worst, tallest) and with things that are unique (the sun, the moon).
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Superlatives and comparatives.
  - Basic Sentence Structure
    - subject + verb + object (SVO)
      - explanation: The most basic sentence structure in English follows the Subject + Verb + Object pattern. The subject performs the action, the verb is the action, and the object receives the action.
      - examples:
        - She reads books.
        - The cat eats fish.
      - usage notes: This is the most common sentence structure in English. The subject typically comes first, followed by the verb and then the object.
      - exceptions: Some sentences do not require an object if the verb is intransitive (e.g., "He runs.").
      - related rules: Intransitive and transitive verbs.
    - subject + verb (SV)
      - explanation: Some sentences consist of just a subject and a verb when the action does not need an object.
      - examples:
        - Birds fly.
        - The sun rises.
      - usage notes: Use this structure when the verb does not require an object, such as with intransitive verbs (verbs that do not need a direct object).
      - exceptions: Some verbs, like "be," often need more elements, like a complement (e.g., "She is happy").
      - related rules: Linking verbs, intransitive verbs.
    - subject + verb + complement (SVC)
      - explanation: Some verbs, especially linking verbs like "be," are followed by a complement instead of an object. The complement describes the subject.
      - examples:
        - She is a teacher.
        - They are happy.
      - usage notes: Use this structure with linking verbs such as "be," "seem," and "become."
      - exceptions: Not all verbs work this way, only linking verbs require complements instead of objects.
      - related rules: Linking verbs, adjectives as complements.
    - question formation
      - explanation: To form a question, invert the subject and auxiliary verb or add an auxiliary verb (e.g., "do," "does") if there isn't one.
      - examples:
        - Do you like coffee?
        - Is she your friend?
      - usage notes: For simple present tense, use "do/does" for questions. For "be" verbs, invert the subject and the verb.
      - exceptions: For questions with "who" or "what" as the subject, no inversion is needed (e.g., "Who called?").
      - related rules: Question words (wh- questions).
    - negative sentences
      - explanation: To make a sentence negative, use the auxiliary verb "do not" (don't) or "does not" (doesn't) for the present tense, or place "not" after the verb "be."
      - examples:
        - She does not like tea.
        - They are not students.
      - usage notes: Use "do/does" for negatives in the simple present, and place "not" after "be" for sentences using the verb "to be."
      - exceptions: For modal verbs (can, will), place "not" after the modal (e.g., "She cannot come").
      - related rules: Auxiliary verbs, negation.
    - compound sentences
      - explanation: Compound sentences join two independent clauses (complete sentences) with a conjunction like "and," "but," or "or."
      - examples:
        - She likes coffee, but he prefers tea.
        - I studied hard, and I passed the exam.
      - usage notes: Use a comma before the conjunction when joining two independent clauses.
      - exceptions: If the clauses are very short, you can omit the comma (e.g., "I came and I saw").
      - related rules: Coordinating conjunctions, sentence types.
    - complex sentences
      - explanation: A complex sentence has one independent clause and at least one dependent clause, often joined by a subordinating conjunction (e.g., "because," "when").
      - examples:
        - I went home because I was tired.
        - When it rains, I stay indoors.
      - usage notes: Use a comma when the dependent clause comes before the independent clause.
      - exceptions: No comma is needed when the independent clause comes first (e.g., "I stay indoors when it rains").
      - related rules: Subordinating conjunctions, dependent clauses.
  - Conjunctions (and, but, or)
    - conjunctions overview
      - explanation: Conjunctions are words used to connect clauses, sentences, or words in the same sentence. The most common conjunctions in A1 grammar are "and," "but," and "or."
      - examples:
        - I like apples and oranges.
        - She is tired, but she will finish her homework.
        - Do you want tea or coffee?
      - usage notes: Conjunctions join words, phrases, or clauses and show relationships between them.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Compound sentences, coordinating conjunctions.
    - and
      - explanation: "And" is used to connect two or more similar ideas or items.
      - examples:
        - He likes swimming and running.
        - I have a pencil and a notebook.
      - usage notes: Use "and" to add ideas or items that are positive or similar.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Addition conjunctions (also, moreover).
    - but
      - explanation: "But" is used to show contrast or opposite ideas.
      - examples:
        - It is raining, but I still want to go out.
        - She is smart, but she is not hardworking.
      - usage notes: Use "but" to introduce an opposing or contrasting idea to the first clause or sentence.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Concession conjunctions (although, however).
    - or
      - explanation: "Or" is used to present a choice or alternative between two or more options.
      - examples:
        - Do you want pizza or pasta?
        - We can stay home or go to the park.
      - usage notes: Use "or" to offer a choice or different options.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Alternative conjunctions (either...or, neither...nor).
    - sentence structure with conjunctions
      - explanation: Conjunctions can connect two independent clauses to form a compound sentence.
      - examples:
        - I want to play, but I have to study.
        - She likes reading, and she enjoys writing.
      - usage notes: When joining two independent clauses with "and," "but," or "or," a comma is placed before the conjunction.
      - exceptions: If the clauses are short, the comma may be omitted (e.g., "I came and I saw").
      - related rules: Compound sentences, commas in compound sentences.
    - compound sentences with conjunctions
      - explanation: A compound sentence contains two or more independent clauses joined by a conjunction.
      - examples:
        - She is cooking dinner, and he is setting the table.
        - He doesn’t like coffee, but he drinks it anyway.
      - usage notes: Compound sentences allow you to combine multiple ideas in one sentence using "and," "but," or "or."
      - exceptions: When using conjunctions in lists, a comma before the last conjunction is optional (e.g., "apples, oranges, and bananas").
      - related rules: Coordinating conjunctions, punctuation in lists.
  - Demonstratives (this, that, these, those)
    - singular demonstratives: this and that
      - explanation: 'This' is used to refer to something close to the speaker, while 'that' is used to refer to something farther away. Both are used with singular nouns.
      - examples:
        - This is my pen. (near)
        - That is your car. (far)
      - usage notes: Use 'this' for objects or people that are near in space or time and 'that' for objects or people farther away.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Demonstratives with singular nouns and demonstrative adjectives.
    - plural demonstratives: these and those
      - explanation: 'These' is used to refer to multiple things close to the speaker, and 'those' is used to refer to multiple things farther away. Both are used with plural nouns.
      - examples:
        - These are my books. (near)
        - Those are her shoes. (far)
      - usage notes: Use 'these' when referring to things nearby and 'those' when referring to things farther away.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Demonstratives with plural nouns.
    - demonstratives as adjectives
      - explanation: Demonstratives can be used before nouns as adjectives to indicate which specific person or thing is being referred to.
      - examples:
        - This car is fast.
        - Those dogs are barking loudly.
      - usage notes: Demonstrative adjectives must always be followed by a noun, and they clarify which noun is being referred to.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Adjectives and determiners.
    - demonstratives in time expressions
      - explanation: Demonstratives can also refer to time, with 'this' referring to something happening now or soon and 'that' referring to something further in the past or future.
      - examples:
        - This weekend, I will visit my parents.
        - That day was unforgettable.
      - usage notes: 'This' is often used for present or near-future events, while 'that' refers to something more distant in time.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Time expressions with demonstratives.
    - distinguishing between demonstratives
      - explanation: Choosing the right demonstrative depends on the context and proximity (physical or temporal) to the speaker.
      - examples:
        - This is my favorite movie. (near, singular)
        - Those are my keys on the table. (far, plural)
      - usage notes: Demonstratives should always agree in number with the noun they describe (singular/plural).
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Pronouns and proximity in language.
  - Imperatives
    - affirmative imperatives
      - explanation: Imperative sentences give commands, instructions, or requests. The affirmative form uses the base verb without a subject.
      - examples:
        - Open the door.
        - Please sit down.
      - usage notes: The subject 'you' is implied, so it is not stated. Use the base form of the verb.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative imperatives, polite requests.
    - negative imperatives
      - explanation: To give a command not to do something, use 'do not' (don't) + base verb.
      - examples:
        - Don’t touch that!
        - Do not be late.
      - usage notes: Use 'don’t' for informal situations and 'do not' for formal commands.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Affirmative imperatives.
    - polite imperatives
      - explanation: Adding 'please' before or after the imperative makes it more polite and less direct.
      - examples:
        - Please close the window.
        - Pass me the salt, please.
      - usage notes: Use 'please' to soften the command and make it a polite request.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Requests and suggestions.
    - imperatives with let's
      - explanation: Use 'let’s' + base verb to suggest something to a group that includes the speaker.
      - examples:
        - Let’s go to the park.
        - Let’s start the meeting.
      - usage notes: 'Let’s' is short for 'let us' and is used for suggestions or proposals.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Suggestions, invitations.
    - uses of imperatives
      - explanation: Imperatives are used for commands, instructions, invitations, and advice.
      - examples:
        - Command: Stop talking.
        - Invitation: Come to the party.
        - Advice: Take an umbrella with you.
      - usage notes: Imperatives can have different tones depending on context, from direct orders to polite suggestions.
      - exceptions: Imperatives are not used with 'will' or 'shall'.
      - related rules: Requests, commands, and advice.
  - Modal Verbs (can for ability)
    - using "can" for ability
      - explanation: "Can" is a modal verb used to express ability or capability to do something.
      - examples:
        - I can swim.
        - She can speak three languages.
      - usage notes: "Can" is followed by the base form of the verb without "to." It is used to talk about skills or general abilities.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Other uses of modal verbs (requests, permissions).
    - negative form: "cannot" or "can't"
      - explanation: To express inability, use the negative form "cannot" or the contracted form "can't."
      - examples:
        - He cannot (can't) drive a car.
        - I can't sing very well.
      - usage notes: "Cannot" is a formal negative, while "can't" is the more common, informal form.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative sentences with other modal verbs (couldn't, shouldn't).
    - question form with "can"
      - explanation: To ask about ability, use "Can" at the beginning of a question.
      - examples:
        - Can you play the piano?
        - Can she cook Italian food?
      - usage notes: In questions, "can" comes before the subject, followed by the base form of the verb.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Question formation in other tenses.
    - past ability with "could"
      - explanation: To talk about ability in the past, use "could" instead of "can."
      - examples:
        - When I was a child, I could ride a bike.
        - He could swim when he was younger.
      - usage notes: "Could" is used to express general abilities in the past.
      - exceptions: Use "was/were able to" for specific past achievements.
      - related rules: Past tense, expressing past abilities.
    - sentence structure with "can"
      - explanation: The basic structure for sentences using "can" is subject + can + base verb.
      - examples:
        - They can run fast.
        - You can read this book.
      - usage notes: There is no change in the form of "can" for different subjects (I, you, he, she, etc.).
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Sentence structures with other modal verbs.
    - polite requests with "can"
      - explanation: "Can" is sometimes used to make polite requests, though "could" is more formal.
      - examples:
        - Can you help me, please?
        - Can I borrow your pen?
      - usage notes: Use "can" for informal requests, but use "could" for more polite or formal situations.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Modal verbs for polite requests (could, may, might).
  - Nouns
    - singular and plural nouns
      - explanation: Nouns can be singular (one) or plural (more than one). Plurals are usually formed by adding -s or -es to the singular noun.
      - examples:
        - A cat (singular) -> Cats (plural)
        - A box (singular) -> Boxes (plural)
      - usage notes: Use singular nouns when referring to one object, and plural nouns when referring to two or more objects.
      - exceptions: Some nouns have irregular plural forms (e.g., man -> men, child -> children).
      - related rules: Countable and uncountable nouns.
    - countable and uncountable nouns
      - explanation: Countable nouns refer to things that can be counted (e.g., "apple"), while uncountable nouns refer to things that cannot be individually counted (e.g., "water").
      - examples:
        - Countable: I have three apples.
        - Uncountable: I need some water.
      - usage notes: Use 'a' or 'an' with singular countable nouns and quantifiers like 'some' or 'any' with uncountable nouns.
      - exceptions: Some nouns can be both countable and uncountable depending on the context (e.g., "chicken" as food vs. the animal).
      - related rules: Quantifiers (some, any, few, many).
    - proper and common nouns
      - explanation: Proper nouns refer to specific names of people, places, or things and are always capitalized. Common nouns are general names of things.
      - examples:
        - Proper: London is a city.

        - She is eating dinner.
        - They are playing football.
      - usage notes: Use "am" with "I," "is" with he/she/it, and "are" with you/we/they.

      - related rules: Future tenses (will, going to).
    - negative form of present continuous
      - explanation: To form the negative, add "not" after the verb "to be" (am not, is not, are not).

      - usage notes: A positive statement is followed by a negative tag, and a negative statement is followed by a positive tag.
      - exceptions: Sometimes, intonation changes meaning (rising for uncertainty, falling for confirmation).
      - related rules: Inversion in questions.
    - forming question tags
      - explanation: Question tags are formed using the auxiliary or modal verb from the main sentence, followed by a subject pronoun.
      - examples:
        - She can swim, can’t she?
        - They weren’t here, were they?

  - Stative Verbs
    - definition and use of stative verbs
      - explanation: Stative verbs describe states or conditions (e.g., thoughts, emotions, senses) rather than actions. They often express ideas such as possession, belief, or preferences.
      - examples:
        - I know the answer.
        - She loves chocolate.
      - usage notes: Stative verbs are typically used in the present simple tense, as they describe states that don't usually change quickly.

      - related rules: Present simple tense, verbs of action.
    - types of stative verbs
