  - Phrasal Verbs (Advanced)
    - Types of Phrasal Verbs
      - multi-word phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that consist of a verb and two or more particles, often creating idiomatic meanings.
        - examples:
          - She **ran out of** patience.
          - They **broke up with** their friends.
        - usage notes: Often have specific meanings that cannot be easily deduced from the individual words.
        - exceptions: Not all verbs can form multi-word phrasal verbs; some have fixed structures.
        - related rules: idiomatic expressions, verb-particle combinations
      - phrasal verbs with prepositions
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that use prepositions instead of adverbs as particles, often indicating direction or location.
        - examples:
          - He **looked into** the matter thoroughly.
          - She **gave up on** her dreams.
        - usage notes: Prepositions change the meaning of the verb and often require specific object placements.
        - exceptions: Some prepositions can interchange without changing the meaning, while others cannot.
        - related rules: verb-preposition collocations, prepositional phrases
      - reversible phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs where the object can be placed either between the verb and particle or after the particle without changing the meaning.
        - examples:
          - She **turned off** the lights.
          - She **turned the lights off**.
        - usage notes: Common with transitive phrasal verbs; flexibility depends on whether the object is a pronoun.
        - exceptions: When the object is a pronoun, it must come between the verb and the particle.
        - related rules: object placement, separable phrasal verbs
      - non-reversible phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs where the object cannot be placed between the verb and particle, often because the particle is integral to the verb's meaning.
        - examples:
          - He **ran into** an old friend.
          - They **came across** some interesting artifacts.
        - usage notes: The object must follow the particle; cannot be inserted between them.
        - exceptions: Limited to certain verbs and particles that form inseparable phrasal verbs.
        - related rules: inseparable phrasal verbs, verb-particle binding
    - Advanced Phrasal Verbs
      - idiomatic phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs with meanings that are not directly related to the meanings of their individual components.
        - examples:
          - She **broke down** after hearing the news.
          - They **put up with** the noisy neighbors.
        - usage notes: Often used in informal contexts; require memorization due to their idiomatic nature.
        - exceptions: Some idiomatic phrasal verbs can also have literal meanings based on context.
        - related rules: idiomatic expressions, context-dependent meanings
      - phrasal verbs with multiple meanings
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs that can convey different meanings depending on the context or particles used.
        - examples:
          - **Break up**: to end a relationship / to disperse a gathering.
          - **Take off**: to remove clothing / to depart (aircraft).
        - usage notes: Context is crucial to determine the intended meaning; some meanings are more common than others.
        - exceptions: Not all phrasal verbs with multiple meanings can be used interchangeably.
        - related rules: semantic flexibility, contextual clues
    - Phrasal Verbs and Collocations
      - verb-particle collocations
        - explanation: Common pairings of verbs with specific particles that frequently occur together.
        - examples:
          - **Carry out** an experiment.
          - **Look forward to** the weekend.
        - usage notes: Knowing common collocations helps in using phrasal verbs correctly and naturally.
        - exceptions: Some verbs can pair with multiple particles, each altering the meaning.
        - related rules: collocation patterns, natural language use
      - noun-particle collocations
        - explanation: Phrasal verbs where the particle combines with a noun to create a specific meaning.
        - examples:
          - **Fill out** a form.
          - **Set up** a meeting.
        - usage notes: Often used in formal or business contexts; the noun can sometimes affect separability.
        - exceptions: Certain noun-particle combinations may have fixed positions.
        - related rules: verb-noun relationships, fixed expressions
    - Phrasal Verbs in Different Tenses
      - past perfect phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Using phrasal verbs in the past perfect tense to describe actions that were completed before another past action.
        - examples:
          - She **had turned off** the lights before leaving.
          - They **had set up** the equipment by the time we arrived.
        - usage notes: Combine the past perfect form of "to have" with the past participle of the phrasal verb.
        - exceptions: Irregular phrasal verbs require correct past participle forms.
        - related rules: past perfect tense, verb conjugation
      - continuous phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Using phrasal verbs in continuous tenses to emphasize ongoing actions.
        - examples:
          - He **is putting off** his responsibilities.
          - They **were looking into** the issue all morning.
        - usage notes: Combine the appropriate form of "to be" with the gerund form of the phrasal verb.
        - exceptions: Some phrasal verbs are not typically used in continuous forms.
        - related rules: continuous tenses, progressive aspect
      - perfect continuous phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Using phrasal verbs in the perfect continuous tense to describe actions that were ongoing up until a certain point in time.
        - examples:
          - She **has been working on** the project for hours.
          - They **had been trying to figure out** the problem before help arrived.
        - usage notes: Combine the perfect continuous form of "to be" with the gerund form of the phrasal verb.
        - exceptions: Limited use with certain phrasal verbs that do not support continuous aspects.
        - related rules: perfect continuous tense, verb aspect
    - Phrasal Verbs in Passive Voice
      - forming passive phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Converting active phrasal verbs into passive voice to focus on the action rather than the doer.
        - examples:
          - Active: They **set up** the equipment.
          - Passive: The equipment **was set up**.
          - Active: She **looked after** the children.
          - Passive: The children **were looked after**.
        - usage notes: The object of the active sentence becomes the subject of the passive sentence; adjust the form of "to be" accordingly.
        - exceptions: Inseparable phrasal verbs must maintain their structure in passive voice.
        - related rules: passive voice formation, object-subject transformation
      - passive with multi-word phrasal verbs
        - explanation: Handling passive constructions when dealing with multi-word phrasal verbs, ensuring clarity and grammatical correctness.
        - examples:
