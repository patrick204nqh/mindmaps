  - Reported Speech (Advanced)
    - Reporting Verbs

        - related rules: choosing appropriate reporting verbs, verb-object agreement
      - report, claim, insist, suggest, recommend

        - related rules: nuanced reporting, verb selection in reported speech
    - Advanced Tense Changes
      - sequence of tenses with perfect tenses
        - explanation: Ensuring that the tense in the reported speech follows the sequence of tenses rules, especially when the original speech contains perfect tenses.
