          - She suggested **going** to the park.
        - usage notes: Use gerunds after verbs that express likes, dislikes, suggestions, and similar actions.

        - related rules: verb + infinitive patterns, verb categorization

        - related rules: verb + gerund patterns, verb categorization
    - After Certain Verbs

        - usage notes: Understand the subtle differences in meaning when a verb is followed by a gerund or an infinitive.
        - exceptions: Not all verbs that take both forms have different meanings; some retain the same meaning.
        - related rules: verb categorization, verb patterns
    - After Prepositions
      - preposition + gerund
        - explanation: After prepositions, gerunds are used to link the preposition to the main verb.
        - examples:
          - She is interested **in learning** new languages.
          - They talked **about going** to the museum.

        - related rules: prepositional phrases, gerund usage
    - Subject/Object Roles
      - gerunds as subjects
        - explanation: Gerunds can function as the subject of a sentence, acting as a noun.
        - examples:
          - **Swimming** is good for your health.
          - **Reading** improves your vocabulary.
        - usage notes: Use gerunds as subjects to emphasize the action or process.
        - exceptions: Use of gerund as subject may sound formal; infinitives can sometimes be used alternatively.
        - related rules: noun functions, sentence structure
      - gerunds as objects
        - explanation: Gerunds can act as objects of verbs, prepositions, or expressions.
        - examples:
          - She enjoys **dancing**.
          - They are interested **in studying** abroad.
        - usage notes: Use gerunds as objects after verbs that are followed by gerunds.

        - related rules: verb patterns, object roles
      - infinitives as subjects
        - explanation: Infinitives can function as the subject of a sentence, similar to gerunds.
        - examples:
          - **To learn** a new language is challenging.
          - **To travel** broadens the mind.
        - usage notes: Use infinitives as subjects to emphasize the purpose or intention behind actions.

    - Meaning Differences
      - verbs with different meanings for gerund vs. infinitive

        - related rules: verb categorization, verb patterns
    - Expressing Purpose
      - infinitives to express purpose
        - explanation: Infinitives can be used to express the purpose of an action, indicating why something is done.
        - examples:
          - She went to the store **to buy** groceries.
          - They called **to invite** you to the party.

        - related rules: expressing intentions, infinitive usage
    - Verb + Object + Infinitive
      - causative verbs with object + infinitive
        - explanation: Some verbs require the structure of verb + object + infinitive to indicate causation or allowing someone to do something.

        - related rules: verb patterns, causative verbs
    - Phrasal Verbs with Gerunds and Infinitives
      - separable phrasal verbs with infinitives
        - explanation: Some phrasal verbs are separable and can take an object before or after the infinitive.

          - He **turned off** the light. → He **turned the light off**.
          - They **looked up** the information. → They **looked the information up**.

        - related rules: phrasal verb separability, verb-object placement
      - inseparable phrasal verbs with gerunds
        - explanation: Some phrasal verbs are inseparable and require the object to follow the phrasal verb when using gerunds.
        - examples:
          - She **runs into** problems when **trying** to fix the issue.
          - They **came across** someone **working** on the project.
        - usage notes: Keep the phrasal verb intact when followed by gerunds; the object cannot be separated.
