  - Adverbs of Frequency

    - definition and use of adverbs of frequency

      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency describe how often an action happens, such as "always," "usually," "often," "sometimes," "rarely," "never."
      - examples:
        - She always wakes up early.
        - They rarely go to the cinema.
      - usage notes: Adverbs of frequency are commonly placed before the main verb but after the verb "to be."
      - exceptions: Some adverbs (e.g., "always," "never") can also start a sentence for emphasis.
      - related rules: Present simple tense for habitual actions.

    - placement in sentences

      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency typically come before the main verb or after the verb "to be."
      - examples:
        - I often play tennis.
        - He is always late.
      - usage notes: With auxiliary verbs (e.g., "have," "will"), the adverb goes between the auxiliary and the main verb.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Word order with adverbs in sentences.

    - using "always"

      - explanation: "Always" means that something happens every time, without exception.
      - examples:
        - She always brings her notebook to class.
        - He is always on time.
      - usage notes: Use "always" for actions that happen regularly without fail.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Adverbs of frequency with high certainty.

    - using "never"

      - explanation: "Never" means that something does not happen at any time.
      - examples:
        - I never eat fast food.
        - They are never late for meetings.
      - usage notes: "Never" is already negative, so it is not used with "not" or other negatives.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative adverbs, double negatives.

    - other common adverbs of frequency

      - explanation: Other adverbs of frequency include "usually," "often," "sometimes," "rarely," and "seldom," which describe how often something happens.
      - examples:
        - She usually walks to work.
        - They sometimes watch movies on weekends.
      - usage notes: These adverbs express a range of frequency from high to low.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Frequency adverbs and present simple for habits.

        - I always brush my teeth in the morning.
        - They never miss a chance to travel.
