  - Present Continuous

    - formation of present continuous

      - explanation: The Present Continuous tense is formed using the verb "to be" (am, is, are) + the base verb + -ing.
      - examples:
        - She is eating dinner.
        - They are playing football.
      - usage notes: Use "am" with "I," "is" with he/she/it, and "are" with you/we/they.
      - exceptions: Some verbs require spelling changes when adding -ing (e.g., "run" -> "running").
      - related rules: Present simple tense, verb forms.

    - use of present continuous for actions happening now

      - explanation: The Present Continuous is used to describe actions that are happening at the moment of speaking.
      - examples:
        - I am studying English right now.
        - He is watching TV.
      - usage notes: Use time expressions like "now" and "at the moment" to emphasize that the action is ongoing.
      - exceptions: Stative verbs (e.g., "know," "like") are not usually used in the continuous form.
      - related rules: Present simple for habitual actions.

    - use of present continuous for temporary actions

      - explanation: The Present Continuous is also used to describe temporary actions or situations that are happening for a limited period.
      - examples:
        - She is staying with her friends for the summer.
        - They are living in New York this month.
      - usage notes: This tense emphasizes that the action is not permanent.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Present simple for permanent situations.

    - use of present continuous for future plans

      - explanation: The Present Continuous can be used to describe fixed plans or arrangements in the near future.
      - examples:
        - We are meeting them tomorrow.
        - She is flying to Paris next week.
      - usage notes: Use the Present Continuous with future time expressions (e.g., tomorrow, next week).
      - exceptions: This usage is mainly for personal plans, not scheduled events (e.g., use present simple for official timetables).
      - related rules: Future tenses (will, going to).

    - negative form of present continuous

      - explanation: To form the negative, add "not" after the verb "to be" (am not, is not, are not).
      - examples:
        - I am not working today.
        - They are not playing outside.
      - usage notes: Use "isn't" or "aren't" in informal speech.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative sentences with other tenses.

    - question form of present continuous

      - explanation: To form a question, invert the subject and the verb "to be" (am, is, are).
      - examples:
        - Are you studying now?
        - Is she coming to the party?
      - usage notes: The structure is: Am/Is/Are + subject + verb (-ing).
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Question formation in other tenses.

    - time expressions with present continuous
      - explanation: Common time expressions used with the Present Continuous include "now," "at the moment," "right now."
      - examples:
        - She is reading a book right now.
        - We are having lunch at the moment.
      - usage notes: These expressions highlight that the action is happening during the time of speaking.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Present simple time expressions (e.g., every day, usually).
