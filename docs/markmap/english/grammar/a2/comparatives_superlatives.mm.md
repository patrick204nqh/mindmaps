  - Comparatives & Superlatives

    - formation of comparatives

      - explanation: Comparatives are used to compare two people, places, things, or ideas. For one-syllable adjectives, add -er; for adjectives with two or more syllables, use "more" before the adjective.
      - examples:
        - She is taller than her brother.
        - This book is more interesting than that one.
      - usage notes: Use "than" to compare two items or people.
      - exceptions: Irregular adjectives like "good" -> "better."
      - related rules: Superlatives for comparisons involving three or more.

    - formation of superlatives

      - explanation: Superlatives are used to show the highest degree of a quality when comparing three or more items. For one-syllable adjectives, add -est; for adjectives with two or more syllables, use "most" before the adjective.
      - examples:
        - He is the tallest person in the room.
        - This is the most beautiful painting I’ve seen.
      - usage notes: Use "the" before superlatives to emphasize the highest or lowest degree.
      - exceptions: Irregular adjectives like "good" -> "best."
      - related rules: Comparatives for comparing two things.

    - irregular comparatives and superlatives

      - explanation: Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as "good" -> "better" (comparative) and "best" (superlative), "bad" -> "worse" (comparative) and "worst" (superlative).
      - examples:
        - This pizza is better than the last one.
        - That was the worst movie I've ever watched.
      - usage notes: These forms need to be memorized, as they do not follow the regular patterns.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Other irregular forms (e.g., "far" -> "further" or "farther").

    - comparative structure with "as...as"

      - explanation: Use "as...as" to compare two things that are equal in some way.
      - examples:
        - She is as tall as her sister.
        - This car is as expensive as that one.
      - usage notes: "As...as" is used to emphasize equality between two people or things.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Comparatives for unequal comparisons.

    - sentence structure with comparatives

      - explanation: Comparatives follow the structure: subject + verb + comparative adjective + than + noun/pronoun.
      - examples:
        - He runs faster than I do.
        - This cake tastes better than the other one.
      - usage notes: Ensure you use "than" after the comparative adjective to make the comparison.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Word order in comparative sentences.

    - sentence structure with superlatives
      - explanation: Superlatives follow the structure: subject + verb + the + superlative adjective + noun.
      - examples:
        - She is the smartest student in the class.
        - That was the most exciting trip we’ve ever taken.
      - usage notes: Use "the" before the superlative adjective to emphasize the extreme quality.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Word order in superlative sentences.
