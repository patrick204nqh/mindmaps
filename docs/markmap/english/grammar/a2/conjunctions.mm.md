# Grammar

- A2

  - Conjunctions (because, so)

    - definition and use of conjunctions

      - explanation: Conjunctions like "because" and "so" connect clauses, providing reasons or results.
      - examples:
        - I stayed home because it was raining.
        - It was raining, so I stayed home.
      - usage notes: "Because" explains the reason for something, while "so" shows the result or consequence.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Compound sentences, cause and effect.

    - using "because"

      - explanation: "Because" introduces a reason and is followed by a clause explaining why something happened.
      - examples:
        - She was late because the bus broke down.
        - I didn’t go to the party because I was sick.
      - usage notes: "Because" connects the main clause with the reason and usually follows the main action.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Other subordinating conjunctions like "since" or "as."

    - using "so"

      - explanation: "So" introduces a result or consequence of the action in the first clause.
      - examples:
        - It was cold, so I wore a jacket.
        - He didn’t study, so he failed the exam.
      - usage notes: "So" introduces the consequence of the first clause and is often used in cause-and-effect sentences.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Coordinating conjunctions.

    - sentence structure with "because" and "so"

      - explanation: "Because" connects a main clause and a subordinate clause (reason), while "so" connects two independent clauses (cause and result).
      - examples:
        - I went to bed early because I was tired.
        - The movie was boring, so we left early.
      - usage notes: "Because" introduces the reason, while "so" introduces the result of the first clause.
      - exceptions: In informal speech, "because" can be used without a complete clause (e.g., "Because reasons").
      - related rules: Sentence structure with conjunctions.

    - common mistakes with "because" and "so"
      - explanation: Learners often use these conjunctions incorrectly, placing "so" where "because" is needed or using both in the same sentence.
      - examples:
        - Incorrect: I stayed home so it was raining. (Correct: I stayed home because it was raining.)
        - Incorrect: I didn’t go because so I was tired. (Correct: I didn’t go because I was tired OR I was tired, so I didn’t go.)
      - usage notes: Avoid using both "because" and "so" together in the same sentence.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Use of subordinating and coordinating conjunctions.
