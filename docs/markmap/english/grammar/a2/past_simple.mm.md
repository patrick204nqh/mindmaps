  - Past Simple

    - formation of past simple

      - explanation: The Past Simple tense is used to describe completed actions or events that happened at a specific time in the past. Regular verbs are formed by adding -ed to the base verb.
      - examples:
        - She walked to the store.
        - They played football yesterday.
      - usage notes: For regular verbs, add -ed. For irregular verbs, use the correct past form (e.g., "go" -> "went").
      - exceptions: Spelling changes apply for some verbs (e.g., "study" -> "studied").
      - related rules: Irregular verbs, spelling changes.

    - past simple with irregular verbs

      - explanation: Irregular verbs do not follow the -ed rule and have their own forms for the past simple.
      - examples:
        - I went to the park.
        - He ate dinner at 7 p.m.
      - usage notes: Irregular verbs must be memorized as they do not follow a regular pattern.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Verb tables for irregular verbs.

    - negative form in past simple

      - explanation: To form the negative in the Past Simple, use "did not" (didn't) + the base verb.
      - examples:
        - She did not (didn't) see the movie.
        - They didn't finish their homework.
      - usage notes: The main verb stays in the base form after "did not."
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative sentences with other tenses.

    - question form in past simple

      - explanation: To form questions in the Past Simple, use "Did" + subject + base verb.
      - examples:
        - Did you visit your grandparents?
        - Did they enjoy the party?
      - usage notes: Use "did" at the beginning of the question, and the main verb remains in its base form.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Question formation in other tenses.

    - use of past simple for completed actions

      - explanation: The Past Simple is used to talk about actions that started and finished in the past.
      - examples:
        - He visited London last year.
        - I watched a movie last night.
      - usage notes: Use time expressions like "yesterday," "last week," "in 2010" to indicate the past.
      - exceptions: None.
