  - Question Tags

    - definition and use of question tags

      - explanation: Question tags are short questions added to the end of statements to confirm or check information.
      - examples:
        - It’s a nice day, isn’t it?
        - You don’t like coffee, do you?
      - usage notes: A positive statement is followed by a negative tag, and a negative statement is followed by a positive tag.
      - exceptions: Sometimes, intonation changes meaning (rising for uncertainty, falling for confirmation).
      - related rules: Inversion in questions.

    - forming question tags

      - explanation: Question tags are formed using the auxiliary or modal verb from the main sentence, followed by a subject pronoun.
      - examples:
        - She can swim, can’t she?
        - They weren’t here, were they?
      - usage notes: If there is no auxiliary verb, use "do/does" for present simple or "did" for past simple.
      - exceptions: Some irregular forms, like "I am," use "aren’t I" instead of "amn't I."
      - related rules: Auxiliary verbs and modals.

    - positive and negative statements with question tags

      - explanation: A positive sentence takes a negative question tag, and a negative sentence takes a positive question tag.
      - examples:
        - You’re coming to the party, aren’t you?
        - She didn’t finish the homework, did she?
      - usage notes: The statement and the tag should match in terms of tense and modal verb.
      - exceptions: With imperative sentences, the question tag can use "will you?" for requests or "won’t you?" for invitations.
      - related rules: Sentence polarity (positive/negative).

    - question tags with different tenses

      - explanation: The verb in the question tag must match the tense of the main verb in the sentence.
      - examples:
        - He was at home, wasn’t he? (past simple)
        - You’ve seen this movie, haven’t you? (present perfect)
      - usage notes: Pay attention to the tense when forming the correct question tag.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Verb tenses in English.

    - common mistakes with question tags

      - explanation: Learners often mismatch the tense or use the wrong auxiliary verb when forming question tags.
      - examples:
        - Incorrect: She doesn’t like tea, isn’t she? (Correct: She doesn’t like tea, does she?)
        - Incorrect: They were late, don’t they? (Correct: They were late, weren’t they?)
      - usage notes: Always use the auxiliary or modal verb from the sentence for the tag.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Auxiliary verbs, modal verbs.

    - using question tags for politeness
      - explanation: Question tags can be used to soften requests or statements, making them sound more polite.
      - examples:
        - You could help me with this, couldn’t you?
        - Let’s go to the park, shall we?
      - usage notes: Question tags can soften the tone or seek agreement in a conversation.
      - exceptions: Imperative sentences often use "will you?" or "would you?" to sound more polite.
      - related rules: Polite requests and commands.
