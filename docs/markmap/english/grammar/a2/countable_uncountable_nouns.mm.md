  - Countable and Uncountable Nouns

    - definition of countable nouns

      - explanation: Countable nouns refer to things that can be counted as individual units. They have both singular and plural forms.
      - examples:
        - I have an apple. (singular)
        - There are five apples. (plural)
      - usage notes: Countable nouns use "a/an" for singular and numbers or "many/few" for plural.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Use of articles with singular and plural countable nouns.

    - definition of uncountable nouns

      - explanation: Uncountable nouns refer to things that cannot be counted individually and do not have plural forms.
      - examples:
        - She drinks water. (singular)
        - There is no sugar left. (singular)
      - usage notes: Uncountable nouns cannot be used with "a/an" and are measured using quantities (e.g., "a bottle of water").
      - exceptions: Some nouns can be both countable and uncountable depending on the context (e.g., "hair" as a mass or individual strands).
      - related rules: Use of "some/any" with uncountable nouns.

    - countable vs uncountable nouns

      - explanation: Countable nouns refer to separate items (e.g., books, cars), while uncountable nouns refer to substances or abstract concepts (e.g., milk, information).
      - examples:
        - Countable: I bought three books.
        - Uncountable: I need some advice.
      - usage notes: "Some" and "any" can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns, but for countable nouns, they often use "few/many," and for uncountable nouns, "little/much."
      - exceptions: Some nouns, like "time," can be both countable and uncountable depending on meaning.
