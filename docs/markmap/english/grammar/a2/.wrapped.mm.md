  - Adverbs of Frequency
    - definition and use of adverbs of frequency
      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency describe how often an action happens, such as "always," "usually," "often," "sometimes," "rarely," "never."
      - examples:
        - She always wakes up early.
        - They rarely go to the cinema.
      - usage notes: Adverbs of frequency are commonly placed before the main verb but after the verb "to be."
      - exceptions: Some adverbs (e.g., "always," "never") can also start a sentence for emphasis.
      - related rules: Present simple tense for habitual actions.
    - placement in sentences
      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency typically come before the main verb or after the verb "to be."
      - examples:
        - I often play tennis.
        - He is always late.
      - usage notes: With auxiliary verbs (e.g., "have," "will"), the adverb goes between the auxiliary and the main verb.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Word order with adverbs in sentences.
    - using "always"
      - explanation: "Always" means that something happens every time, without exception.
      - examples:
        - She always brings her notebook to class.
        - He is always on time.
      - usage notes: Use "always" for actions that happen regularly without fail.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Adverbs of frequency with high certainty.
    - using "never"
      - explanation: "Never" means that something does not happen at any time.
      - examples:
        - I never eat fast food.
        - They are never late for meetings.
      - usage notes: "Never" is already negative, so it is not used with "not" or other negatives.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Negative adverbs, double negatives.
    - other common adverbs of frequency
      - explanation: Other adverbs of frequency include "usually," "often," "sometimes," "rarely," and "seldom," which describe how often something happens.
      - examples:
        - She usually walks to work.
        - They sometimes watch movies on weekends.
      - usage notes: These adverbs express a range of frequency from high to low.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Frequency adverbs and present simple for habits.
    - frequency adverbs and present simple tense
      - explanation: Adverbs of frequency are most commonly used with the present simple tense to describe habitual actions.
      - examples:
        - I always brush my teeth in the morning.
        - They never miss a chance to travel.

  - Comparatives & Superlatives
    - formation of comparatives
      - explanation: Comparatives are used to compare two people, places, things, or ideas. For one-syllable adjectives, add -er; for adjectives with two or more syllables, use "more" before the adjective.
      - examples:
        - She is taller than her brother.
        - This book is more interesting than that one.
      - usage notes: Use "than" to compare two items or people.
      - exceptions: Irregular adjectives like "good" -> "better."
      - related rules: Superlatives for comparisons involving three or more.
    - formation of superlatives
      - explanation: Superlatives are used to show the highest degree of a quality when comparing three or more items. For one-syllable adjectives, add -est; for adjectives with two or more syllables, use "most" before the adjective.
      - examples:
        - He is the tallest person in the room.
        - This is the most beautiful painting I’ve seen.
      - usage notes: Use "the" before superlatives to emphasize the highest or lowest degree.
      - exceptions: Irregular adjectives like "good" -> "best."
      - related rules: Comparatives for comparing two things.
    - irregular comparatives and superlatives
      - explanation: Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as "good" -> "better" (comparative) and "best" (superlative), "bad" -> "worse" (comparative) and "worst" (superlative).
      - examples:
        - This pizza is better than the last one.
        - That was the worst movie I've ever watched.
      - usage notes: These forms need to be memorized, as they do not follow the regular patterns.

      - related rules: Other irregular forms (e.g., "far" -> "further" or "farther").
    - comparative structure with "as...as"
      - explanation: Use "as...as" to compare two things that are equal in some way.
      - examples:
        - She is as tall as her sister.
        - This car is as expensive as that one.
      - usage notes: "As...as" is used to emphasize equality between two people or things.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Comparatives for unequal comparisons.
    - sentence structure with comparatives
      - explanation: Comparatives follow the structure: subject + verb + comparative adjective + than + noun/pronoun.
      - examples:
        - He runs faster than I do.
        - This cake tastes better than the other one.
      - usage notes: Ensure you use "than" after the comparative adjective to make the comparison.
      - exceptions: None.
      - related rules: Word order in comparative sentences.
    - sentence structure with superlatives
      - explanation: Superlatives follow the structure: subject + verb + the + superlative adjective + noun.

        - She is the smartest student in the class.
        - That was the most exciting trip we’ve ever taken.

  - Conjunctions (because, so)
    - definition and use of conjunctions

    - using "so"

      - related rules: Coordinating conjunctions.
    - sentence structure with "because" and "so"
      - explanation: "Because" connects a main clause and a subordinate clause (reason), while "so" connects two independent clauses (cause and result).
      - examples:
        - I went to bed early because I was tired.
        - The movie was boring, so we left early.
      - usage notes: "Because" introduces the reason, while "so" introduces the result of the first clause.

      - related rules: Sentence structure with conjunctions.
    - common mistakes with "because" and "so"
      - explanation: Learners often use these conjunctions incorrectly, placing "so" where "because" is needed or using both in the same sentence.
      - examples:
        - Incorrect: I stayed home so it was raining. (Correct: I stayed home because it was raining.)
        - Incorrect: I didn’t go because so I was tired. (Correct: I didn’t go because I was tired OR I was tired, so I didn’t go.)
