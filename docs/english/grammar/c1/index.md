# C1 Grammar Overview

At the **C1 level**, you will learn advanced grammar structures that allow you to express yourself with more **fluency**, **precision**, and **complexity**. This includes mastering sophisticated grammatical elements like **inversion**, **mixed conditionals**, and **nominalization**, which are crucial for formal writing and nuanced communication.

## Topics Covered:

---

### **1. Inversion**

Learn how to use **inversion** to emphasize certain parts of a sentence, particularly in formal or literary contexts.

- **[Inversion](inversion.md)**: Understand how to invert the normal word order (subject-verb) in certain sentence types for emphasis, particularly with negative adverbials.
  - Example: _Never have I seen such an amazing performance._
  - Example: _Not only did she win the race, but she also broke the record._

### **2. Mixed Conditionals**

Explore the advanced use of **mixed conditionals** to discuss **hypothetical past situations** with **present or future consequences** and vice versa.

- **[Mixed Conditionals](mixed_conditionals.md)**: Learn how to combine different conditionals to express **complex, hypothetical scenarios** where past, present, and future events are mixed.
  - Example: _If I had studied harder, I would be passing the exam now._
  - Example: _If I weren’t so busy, I would have gone to the party last night._

### **3. Nominalization**

Master the art of **nominalization**, turning verbs and adjectives into nouns to create more formal and academic writing.

- **[Nominalization](nominalization.md)**: Learn how to turn **verbs** and **adjectives** into **nouns** to add formality and complexity to your writing, especially in academic and business contexts.
  - Example: _The committee reached a decision._ (instead of _The committee decided._)

### **4. Ellipsis & Substitution**

Refine your ability to use **ellipsis** and **substitution** to avoid repetition and make your sentences more concise and sophisticated.

- **[Ellipsis & Substitution](ellipsis_and_substitution.md)**: Learn how to use **ellipsis** (omitting words) and **substitution** (replacing words) to create more fluent and natural speech and writing.
  - Example (Ellipsis): _I don’t know, but she might._ (instead of _she might know_)
  - Example (Substitution): _I prefer the blue one._ (_one_ replaces "blue shirt")

### **5. Advanced Clauses**

Explore a range of **advanced clause structures** that add complexity and depth to your sentences.

- **[Advanced Clauses](advanced_clauses.md)**: Learn how to use different types of clauses—such as **adverbial**, **relative**, and **noun clauses**—to express more complex ideas and create richer sentences.
  - Example (Noun Clause): _I believe that she is the best candidate for the job._
