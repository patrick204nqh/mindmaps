# A2 Grammar Overview

At the **A2 level**, you will build on the grammar foundation learned in **A1** by expanding your knowledge of verb tenses, adjectives, and comparative structures. You’ll also learn to describe actions and states more effectively using different tenses, and you'll be able to form more complex sentences.

## Topics Covered:

---

### **1. Verbs & Tenses**

Learn more advanced verb tenses to describe actions happening in the present and past. This section also introduces **stative verbs**, which describe states of being or emotions rather than actions.

- **[Present Continuous](present_continuous.md)**: Learn how to talk about actions happening **right now** or in the near future using the **Present Continuous tense**.

  - Example: _I am studying English right now._

- **[Past Simple](past_simple.md)**: Understand how to talk about **completed actions in the past** using the **Past Simple tense**, including regular and irregular verbs.

  - Example: _I visited Paris last summer._

- **[Stative Verbs](stative_verbs.md)**: Discover how to use **stative verbs** to describe **emotions, feelings, or states**. These verbs are typically not used in continuous forms.
  - Example: _I love chocolate_ (not _I am loving chocolate_).

### **2. Comparatives & Superlatives**

Learn how to compare people, things, or places by using **comparative and superlative** adjectives.

- **[Comparatives & Superlatives](comparatives_superlatives.md)**: Understand how to form and use adjectives like _bigger, more interesting_ (comparative) and _the biggest, the most interesting_ (superlative) to make comparisons.

  - Example: _She gave it to me._ (subject: _She_, object: _me_).

### **4. Basic Prepositions**

Master the use of basic **prepositions** to describe locations, times, and movements.

- **[Basic Prepositions](prepositions.md)**: Learn how to use common prepositions like _in, on, at, under, over_ to give more context to your sentences.
