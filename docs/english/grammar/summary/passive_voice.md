# Passive Voice Overview

The passive voice is used to emphasize the action or the recipient of the action rather than the doer. Understanding the passive voice is essential for expressing actions in a different light and is commonly used in formal writing.

## 1. Definition

In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence receives the action rather than performing it. This structure allows the speaker or writer to focus on the action itself or the person affected by the action.

## 2. Structure of Passive Voice

The passive voice is formed using the verb "to be" + past participle of the main verb. The structure is as follows:

### Examples:

- **Active**: "The chef cooks the meal."
- **Passive**: "The meal is cooked (by the chef)."
