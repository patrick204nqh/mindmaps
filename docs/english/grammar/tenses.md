## Overview of Tenses

In English, tenses are used to show the time of an action or event. There are **three main categories** of tenses: **Past**, **Present**, and **Future**, each with four aspects: **Simple**, **Continuous**, **Perfect**, and **Perfect Continuous**. Here's an overview of the common tenses:

### 1. **Present Tenses**

- **Present Simple**: Used for habitual actions, general truths, and scheduled events.
  - _Example_: "She walks to school."
- **Present Continuous**: Describes actions happening right now or temporary situations.
  - _Example_: "She is walking to school."
- **Present Perfect**: Used to talk about actions that happened at an unspecified time or started in the past and continue to the present.
  - _Example_: "She has walked to school."
- **Present Perfect Continuous**: Focuses on actions that started in the past and have continued until now.
  - _Example_: "She has been walking for an hour."

### 2. **Past Tenses**

- **Past Simple**: Describes completed actions in the past.
  - _Example_: "She walked to school yesterday."
- **Past Continuous**: Describes actions that were in progress at a specific moment in the past.
  - _Example_: "She was walking when it started to rain."
- **Past Perfect**: Refers to actions that were completed before another action in the past.
  - _Example_: "She had walked to school before the rain started."
- **Past Perfect Continuous**: Refers to actions that were ongoing before a specific moment in the past.
  - _Example_: "She had been walking for an hour when the rain started."

### 3. **Future Tenses**

- **Future Simple**: Refers to actions that will happen in the future.
  - _Example_: "She will walk to school tomorrow."
- **Future Continuous**: Refers to actions that will be in progress at a specific moment in the future.
  - _Example_: "She will be walking at 8 AM tomorrow."
- **Future Perfect**: Refers to actions that will be completed before a specific time in the future.
  - _Example_: "She will have walked to school by 9 AM."
- **Future Perfect Continuous**: Refers to ongoing actions that will be completed before a specific time in the future.
  - _Example_: "She will have been walking for an hour by the time she reaches school."
